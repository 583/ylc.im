He said the<br>concept of digital currency the central bank (CBDC) is an open question, now<br>the world’s major central banks are concerned about this issue, the central<br>bank to understand the costs and benefits of digital currency, and its trade-<br>off is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>not for members of Congress to ask “When the central bank to launch digital<br>currency (CBDC)” issue, Powell said the Fed has not yet decided whether to<br>launch digital dollar because there are still many problems, such as network,<br>privacy issues, but  working to resolve issues related .</p>
<p>2019 In November 2009, Powell had said before the release of the Bank of<br>digital currency (CBDC), the Fed must address a number of legal issues,<br>including the payment of monetary policy and financial stability, regulatory<br>and operational issues, as well as its vulnerability in the face of cyber<br>attacks.</p>
<p>When asked questions about efforts Libra, China made for the introduction of<br>digital currency and competitive threats exist, Powell said that the current<br>Fed has a lot of projects are being worked on this, and said he fully agreed<br>Libra this point a fire.</p>
<p>In addition, Powell at the hearing expressed support for encrypted anonymous<br>currency trading. For example Monero and Zcash other private currency-based<br>transactions. But he also acknowledged that a completely transparent monetary<br>system, so that everyone can see other people’s transactions and balances,<br>which is not ideal for the US economy.</p>
<p>Prior to the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank of attitudes toward<br>digital currency (CBDC) also changed 180 degrees occurred.</p>
<p>European Central Bank Mario Draghi at the time of any issuance of central bank<br>governor is not in favor digital currency (CBDC).

        <p>Recently, the novel coronavirus infection prevention and control of pneumonia<br>epidemic control work has entered a critical period. In the fight against the<br>epidemic, a big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, new generation<br>of information technology is playing a role, block chain technology with its<br>unique distributed, privacy, and other characteristics can not be tampered<br>with, the addition of anti “plague” army . Reporters learned, Shandong<br>University of Finance and Economics developed the “block chain acquisition<br>epidemic monitoring system” was 2020 at 5:00 on February 7 formally launched,<br>took just two days and nights.</p>
<p><img src="/2020/02/14/577247/0.png" alt></p>
<p>2019 October expedite the implementation of the block chain technological<br>innovation and industrial development of a national strategy. Needed epidemic,<br>Shandong Province, the preparatory group block chain Finance Lab Science and<br>Technology Department of Shandong University of Finance, Ali clouds and other<br>units, research and development of the “block chain epidemic acquisition and<br>monitoring system.” The system proved block chain from three aspects can play<br>an irreplaceable role in the fight against the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>First, the system uses a fast and flexible, easy-to-deploy distributed<br>promotion. The biggest difference cloud computing, using the block chains peer<br>configuration, each unit may be added as a node to the block chains to share<br>data, encrypted storage, traceability and the responsibilities traceability.<br>Mountain financial big block chain system proved a node deployment after about<br>two days, you can start and join block chain. This distributed computing and<br>storage to maximize protect the system from damage caused by attacks and<br>failures; decentralized network structure can be resolved in a short time to<br>large concurrent data access, suitable for short epidemic acquisition time,<br>high occupant density characteristics.</p>
<p>Next, the trusted system through data encryption, to achieve privacy<br>protection, and sharing of traceability effect. Currently the national<br>infectious disease reporting integrity of the data, the accuracy of the high<br>requirements, the need to pay attention to data privacy in the collection, to<br>guard against abuse, thus creating data silos each acquisition or direct<br>reporting system. Data encryption block chain congenital transmission, and<br>synchronized to each node to establish a distributed network of data storage<br>between units, effectively solve the problem of data silos, improve data<br>collection society as a whole outbreaks of infectious diseases and real-time<br>early warning capacity for self do not rely entirely on national infectious<br>disease early warning system. Meanwhile, data traceability features can form a<br>complete, tamper-proof accountable mechanisms to ensure that data based on<br>transparency and supervision of accountable events.</p>
<p>Finally, the system can be keyed open the epidemic data, so that data is more<br>true epidemic. It is understood that the block chain technology as a core<br>technology of the next generation of the Internet, with a decentralized, open<br>and transparent, can not be tampered with, traceability and other features,<br>has a natural advantage in the fight against SARS epidemic prevention. School<br>of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University of Finance and<br>Economics from 2010 peer network research, the current through the block chain<br>digital certificate, IPFS storage network, to gain advantage quantitative<br>analysis and design aspects of the transaction. Using the block chain key<br>technology (similar purse), permission for data storage, and better protect<br>the security of data; data on the block chain certification, can not be<br>altered, they are able to guarantee the authenticity of the epidemic data;<br>sensitive desensitization treatment after data storage, protection of privacy,<br>open sharing of data to achieve the epidemic.</p>
