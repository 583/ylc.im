        <p>In 2008, the global financial crisis, Nakamoto Bitcoin published a white<br>paper, white paper in the circulation of his genius to build a release from<br>the, from any country bound, without any centralized control mechanism, a<br>constant quantity of 21 million electronic cash system. 2009, Nakamoto bit<br>code placing the credits on the White Paper, kicked off from a large block<br>chain and a wave of digital money.</p>
<p><strong>the same strain of credits with a chain</strong></p>
<p>long time, area block chain and digital currency for most people is an<br>inseparable relationship, one is bound to think of another lift, with the rise<br>of the public chain project, gradually have divided “chain ring” and “currency<br>circle”, but we still have a close relationship. In recent years, more and<br>more companies start using the technology block chain, block chain technology<br>industry toward the direction of landing, digital currency has become a new<br>way to invest into ordinary people. Digital currency and block chain start<br>going in different directions.</p>
<p><img src="/2020/02/14/577580/0.png" alt="dDVcN43nY4ilHBvAZU6HFY9AlNqeRlzqYgSxR7ld.jpeg"></p>
<p>family of currency speculation and technology geeks differentiation, the<br>market and industry, probably a good thing. The market began to cool, digital<br>currency for the block chain and have a more clear understanding, all digital<br>currency is no longer a block chain, owned by digital currency digital<br>currency, let go of the chain block chain block, in their respective areas of<br>development, those dressed in the cloak of the block chain technology fried<br>currency speculators were false propaganda has been to gain a foothold in the<br>market.</p>
<p><strong>their path of development</strong></p>
<p>Today, bits credits as the representative of digital currency has been many<br>people’s investment options, some countries are actively exploring the<br>national Bank of digital currency CBDC R &amp; D trial, associated with a series<br>of digital currency regulation bill also proposed. Advantages of digital<br>currency in the financial sector has become increasingly prominent. Even so,<br>we have rational investment, careful selection of investment strategies.</p>
<p>the bit credits, we see the advantages of block chain technology, also see the<br>limitations bit pattern credits. Out of the shackles of Bitcoin, block chain<br>technology began to be favored by more and more businesses and industry, in<br>all walks of life began to apply floor, from the original high cold mysterious<br>existence becomes our daily lives, technology.</p>
<p><strong>Ecology block chain and a combination of digital currency</strong></p>
<p>Nakamoto idea is to build a decentralized ecological, everyone can<br>participate, but without the giant center, why should ordinary people pay to<br>maintain the network in vain it? So, in order to encourage everyone to<br>participate in data maintenance, system block chain will have incentives a<br>digital currency, as long as participation data processing block chain,<br>contribute, you can get mining reward. This is also the reason why the digital<br>currency and block chain close.</p>
<p>In this mode, user digital monetary incentive, the user maintains block<br>chains, forming a positive cycle, a block chain construct unique ecosystems .<br>Once removed from the system in the digital currency, this loop will be<br>broken, the entire system naturally unsustainable.</p>
<p>But from a practical point of view, whether it is business or industry, the<br>practical applications may not require a high degree of decentralization,<br>there are many scenarios without having to digital money as incentives.<br>Gradually form of a chain formed of many well-chain form, chain private, Union<br>chain, to meet the needs of different scenarios. Closely integrated with the<br>architecture of digital currency, is no longer the only choice block chain<br>technology. Decoupling, it became the beginning of a new stage of development<br>of the block chain industry.</p>

        <p>According to public reports, China’s central bank legal digital currency DCEP<br>has been pretty clear in 2019, 2020 would have been landing.</p>
<p>The United States and China’s attitude very different, in December 2019,<br>Federal Reserve Chairman Powell and Treasury Secretary Nuqin the House<br>Financial Services hearing, said they agreed that the  in the next five years,<br>the Fed did not release figures of dollars necessary.  Powell said the Fed has<br>been evaluating the benefits of issuing digital dollar, but “not yet<br>determined the Bank of digital currency (CBDC) potential substantial benefits<br>to the implementation of monetary policy.” The Fed is focused on the<br>development of “all-weather real-time” Real Time Gross and settlement systems,<br>and it is expected to launch in 2023 or 2024.</p>
<p>But in January 20, there are rumors that the Federal Reserve plans to announce<br>a $ digitization plan, similar to the Chinese central bank DCEP.</p>

She said, “Given<br>the importance of the dollar, the United States must remain at the forefront<br>of digital money on the central bank (CBDC) research and policy development.”<br>“As we deepen the understanding of the Bank of digital currency (CBDC), the<br>Fed will work with other The central bank cooperation. “this means that the<br>Fed is now open to the Bank of digital currency (CBDC).</p>
<p>February 11, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell once again attend the House<br>Financial Services Committee hearing, members of Congress said the central<br>bank the Federal Reserve is studying digital currency (CBDC). He said the<br>concept of digital currency the central bank (CBDC) is an open question, now<br>the world’s major central banks are concerned about this issue, the central<br>bank to understand the costs and benefits of digital currency, and its trade-<br>off is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>not for members of Congress to ask “When the central bank to launch digital<br>currency (CBDC)” issue, Powell said the Fed has not yet decided whether to<br>launch digital dollar because there are still many problems, such as network,<br>privacy issues, but  working to resolve issues related .</p>
