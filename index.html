    </h1>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>the second half of 2019, fire coins launched “his VIP that is my VIP” and<br>“All-Star VIP” event a hit from the spot, contract and then to OTC, direct<br>industry “grab” high net worth customers. For a time the major exchanges have<br>followed suit, lowering tariff barriers and VIP. To HT, represented by<br>platform currency is also surging.</p>
<p>February 12 this year, the fire station again announced the global currency<br>rating upgraded user rules and VIP interests. Transactions and positions you<br>can have firepower value, everyone can become a VIP. Market sentiment was<br>immediately ignited, fire coin VIP user interests and values ​​behind HT also<br>a hot topic.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the fire coins at the user level and the rules of<br>equity VIP upgrade for the first time proposed a “fire value” concept. User<br>level will be determined by the value firepower, firepower higher value, the<br>higher the level, the more will enjoy VIP equity. Under the new rules hold HT<br>VIP users will receive double the value of the acceleration firepower become<br>VIP.</p>
<p>Some market participants believe that money to upgrade fire VIP equity, will<br>attract a large number of users for the sprint VIP waist and equity holdings<br>HT, it is expected to have more than 200 potential VIP users HT and potential<br>buying 8 million, equivalent to 2019 Q4 quarter to repurchase the entire<br>amount of HT.</p>
<p>So this “fire value” to be about? What are the rules different VIP levels<br>firepower value corresponds? What are the implications of HT and there will<br>be?</p>
<p><strong>transactions and positions you can have firepower value, become a VIP is not<br>so difficult to imagine</strong></p>
<p>the so-called” fire value “is the credit history of fire users in currency<br>trading near three-month natural or held digital assets can be assets, digital<br>asset positions adopted by transaction number. In addition, users will receive<br>double the firepower to hold HT value of the acceleration to be VIP.</p>
<p>in digital asset transactions, each additional user 2,000 USD equivalent<br>volume, the value obtained a fire; digital asset in position, the user<br>positions the daily USDT, HUSD, HT, BTC, ETH, LTC, EOS, XRP, BCH, TRX, BSV,<br>eTC and other digital assets available “firepower value”, each holding 10,000<br>USDT daily receive up to 1 “firepower value.”</p>
<p>HT may be held in acceleration value is obtained firepower, 11 November 2019 -<br>the period February 11, 2020 (GMT + 8), each user holds 62,501 “firepower<br>value” HT available, from 2020, February 12 (GTM + 8) on, each user is<br>adjusted to hold the value of 5000 USDT of HT, you can get a “firepower<br>value.” In other words, hold HT enjoy double the firepower value, accelerate<br>user to become VIP.</p>
<p><strong>The higher the value of the fire VIP interest, HT accelerator or a VIP</strong></p>
<p>Further Huobi user level determined by the value of the fire, fire higher<br>value, the higher the level, the user will be able to enjoy more VIP rights,<br>the corresponding relationship in the following table:</p>
<p><img src="/2020/02/13/576707/0.png" alt="5pI9Aj5FYh7P8Bo74GBLlKPG4dUCGQdslTRjmV90.png"></p>
<p><strong>updated on grade and is valid</strong> 1 month, the user level is updated based on<br>the current value of firepower, valid until the last day of each month. If the<br>value of the user firepower meet the criteria in any month, day, then go to<br>the next level in real time, the period of validity of the rating upgrade and<br>continue until the last day of next month.</p>
<p><strong>user will face the same level of degradation limit.</strong> when monthly update is<br>rated No. 1, if the user does not meet the minimum requirements of the<br>original level, will face a downgrade, but the downgrade is limited to at most<br>monthly drop level.</p>
<p>Finally, we can see by the rules, holding fire HT users will receive double<br>the value of the acceleration to be VIP. This is undoubtedly a great boon for<br>enabling HT. Especially for users near the VIP level, the assets into the HT<br>that is faster to become VIP, so HT will inevitably lead to huge buying in the<br>user’s waist drive.</p>
<p>currently has positive reaction in the disk, HT prices in the secondary market<br>is strong all the way. Before the existing market participants believe, it is<br>expected to have more than 200 potential VIP users and 8 million potential<br>buying HT, equivalent to 2019 Q4 quarter to repurchase the entire amount of<br>HT. In 2020 HT This is also another major good news, followed by HT price or<br>bring a new surprise to the market.</p>

        <p>With the beginning of the year after Bitcoin rapid rise, the market has for<br>the formation of a new round of Dallas City gradually reached a consensus,<br>particularly in recent Bitcoin back on the 10,000 mark integer;: &lt; “left text-<br>align” p style =&gt; , FOMO sentiment in the market is becoming increasingly<br>apparent, how to grasp this continued rise in prices, it has become the focus<br>of attention of all market participants.</p>
<p>This article will outstripped all the news or the so-called fundamental<br>factors under the premise, I share a simple trading ideas, and this seems<br>simple logic, but just apply to the current Bitcoin market, as to whether the<br>transaction in accordance with the plan, you readers can decisions on their<br>own.</p>
<p>First of all clear that this trading technique does not provide the reader<br>with a very “simple and crude,” the copy trading scheme, the reader needs to<br>be able to determine their own to some extent, in the case of market trend, to<br>find out how effective trading admission time, and how to effectively carry<br>out asset allocation. So, if you want to get down to the specific point single<br>admission, they may let you down.</p>
<p>in the rising trend in market confirmation process, can be very effective<br>average reference “reference.” 50 period moving average and four hours, four<br>hours 200 period moving average and 50 day moving average and 200-day moving<br>average is four very effective technical indicators. Specific use is not<br>complicated, in fact, in order to support this dynamic four line as a<br>reference, in the rising trend in market prices technical adjustments to the<br>configuration ratio of account funds:</p>
<p>4 hour 50 period moving average: 10%</p>
<p>4 hours 200 cycle average: 20%</p>
<p>50-day moving average: 30%</p>
<p>200-day moving average: 40%</p>
<p>4-hour</p>
<p>daily</p>
<p>In simple terms, when the market is hit back to step long entry position with<br>10% of the total capital of 400 hours and 50 period EMA, and step back to hit<br>a configuration of 20% of funds 4 hours 200 period moving average, and so on.</p>
<p>arranged in accordance with the position at the time this method is not<br>recommended at a fixed price or a simple fixed proportion to stop protection,<br>is also recommended to critical moving average manifestations composition as a<br>reference standard. Used as a reference standard also above four moving<br>average, moving average and short period once the downward moving average form<br>Sicha piercing long period, the stop signal is issued, the market will soon<br>rise high probability reversal, it is necessary in this case timely adjustment<br>of the direction of trading options rather than a single continuous cover<br>short positions at prices continue to decline Shihai.</p>
<p>is supported such a simple average system provided / further by resistance<br>point before a high / low before, the key trend line / channel complex like<br>support way to verify, and they are many technical analysis tools Once the key<br>point there is the conclusion overlapping, so sure of trading ideas will be<br>increased dramatically.</p>
<p>In the approaching step back when the market position of the key support<br>short-term trend line key or the like moving average, there is determined a<br>more convenient way to confirm transactions over into field chance has come,<br>that is, three-line / five-wire confirmation method, which is a simplified<br>version of the Bill Williams fractal structure.</p>
<p>In simple terms, the market is concerned effectively reach the front and rear<br>take-up performance of key technical support / resistance reference point<br>three consecutive root node or not the K line. With an upward trend in the<br>callback, for example, need to focus on disk performance when the stock market<br>hit a key moving average back foot / trend line support.</p>
<p>K line when the minimum point where should the effective reach / approaching<br>key support, and an open line K-line before and after each of the T / R line<br>position and Movies line high / low position above the low point of all four<br>dimensions when K line where the reference position, which can be completed in<br>a simple small inflection / determination stabilized, were based on the ratio<br>of the positions mentioned hereinbefore in this case more than a single layout<br>is ideal. (The logic Fractal and three lines of five K-line, were very<br>similar, but uses more time to further reduce the possibility of wrongful<br>convictions because of disorderly market fluctuations may cause the turning<br>point leading to the illusion, and the daily trading process time Game two<br>dimensions and space everywhere)</p>
<p>Finally, it should say is, one thing should be noted that, due to four hours<br>is still regarded as a level graphics short-term graphics, so even in the days<br>of the transaction follow-up, four hours moving average level also displaced<br>many times, so this short-term trading ideas for draining the requirements are<br>relatively high, especially in the market choppy (general in the event of a<br>price band early start), the investors must spend more time to stare disk in<br>real time and adjust the trading scheme, or is likely to lead to missed<br>opportunities for admission to happen.</p>
