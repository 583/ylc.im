        <p>According to reports Trustnodes February 12, capable of carrying about 100,000<br>validator Square 2.0 Ethernet test network upcoming, ongoing stress tests.</p>
<p>Lighthouse developer Paul • Hauner (Paul Hauner) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is state run 0.10.1 version of the conversion code, this is the latest<br>multi-client interoperability specification. “.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lighthouse another developer ainggyi • Manning (Age Manning) said Saturday<br>they are doing the last update, to integrate all of the functions of the main<br>network , we hope to complete this weekend. He said:</p>
<p>Ethernet Square 2.0 Prysmatic another client developers Nigeria Shante • Das<br>(Nishant Das) said they are updated to version 0.10.1 specification. Once this<br>is done, they will develop interoperability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I want to try to run a local Lighthouse test network, interact with a<br>Prysmatic node successfully its, and can successfully interoperate with<br>Lighthouse node then. reverse operation, interaction with the local test<br>Lighthouse Prysmatic network node “</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Manning said that they are focused on the upgrade version of the<br>specification to 0.10.1, and some interoperability.</p>
<p>final stage before interoperability is started, at this stage, developers make<br>different client nodes to each other “interactive” to create a multi-client<br>test network.</p>
<p>Obviously, you can run it on the latest there is 4GB of memory raspberry pie<br>(raspberry pi). Horner said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>. “On the last test network, it has successfully completed the job with a<br>smaller validator counts (16k) &lt; p style = “text-align: left;”&gt; the new<br>version of the 100k, but I think the latest optimization of load is very<br>similar to what I have not prove it, but my gut tells me it can work in this<br>test online. “</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he further said that they are doing optimization, so that it can run on<br>inexpensive hardware.</p>
<p>not clear whether this can be run on the iPhone or Android machine, but the<br>development of mobile Ethernet Status Square Nimbus browser is using the first<br>mobile Square 2.0 Ethernet test network.</p>
<p>Nimbus, Lighthouse Prysmatic and three client looks good interactions with<br>each other, when these three main network preferably starts a client can, but<br>If one behind, you can only use two.</p>
<p>three clients seem to have adequate financial resources to support you. Nimbus<br>and Lighthouse are recruiting developers.</p>
<p>Since Pledge (Staking) reward and punishment design approach, the three<br>clients are required to achieve the selectivity and the diversity, in which at<br>least two within years there will be a lot of work, first introduced slice<br>(sharding), and then improve their work.</p>
<p>As you know, too Square slice will block chain is parallelized to increase its<br>capacity by the number of nodes.</p>
<p>New Proof interest (the PoS) chain beacon (Beacon Chain) from the beginning of<br>the slice is not complete, but some fragment called subnets . • Lighthouse<br>Michael Sproul (Michael Sproul) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“slice subnet is responsible for polymerization to prove before the<br>broadcast of the node group not to make 100,000. their mutual authenticator<br>sent proof, but each committee transmitted between them they prove<br>convenient to construct a large polymeric proof, and the only polymerizable<br>broadcast to everyone. “</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this may work sheet is divided, a group of nodes to each other,” talk “, and<br>then they” chat “sent to another set of nodes.</p>
<p>This means not only Ethernet Square will start this summer pledge, and<br>fragmentation will also begin at that time</p>
