        <p>Spring Festival this year, people across the country are plagued by heart<br>disease. The new coronavirus epidemic raging, Hubei Province affected by the<br>degree of particularly serious. Epidemic not only threatens the health and<br>safety of people, but also cause trauma to the stable economic development,<br>industrial chain block is also not immune.</p>
<p>Under the epidemic, What is the status block chain enterprises to survive?<br>Finance this gold trading platform to connect segments of the industry,<br>mining, security companies, investment institutions such as the head of a<br>number of companies, a list of industry status quo, and seek common<br>development industry in the future.</p>
<p>This article is golden Finance exclusive interview with <strong>Gate.io</strong> Record.</p>
<p><strong>Gold Finance:</strong> What do you think the block chain technology can do for the<br>fight against the epidemic? Specific development space will open up in what<br>areas?</p>
<p><strong>Gate.io wine children:</strong> block chain technology can be very good to enhance<br>the transparency of charitable contributions. Traditional donors, because of<br>the lack of clear oversight and clear information tracking system, in this<br>outbreak, exposed the serious crisis of confidence, which is contrary to the<br>original intention, very sad thing. The tamper-proof block chain and<br>characteristic information can be found just good solution to these problems.<br>From every sum of money to donate supplies, should have its own identity block<br>chain, from beginning to end, we can be clear and easy to see, rather than as<br>they are now blind to donate, it is more urged by public opinion, even<br>ordinary people can also be viewed on the chain to each hospital accepted and<br>the number of materials consumed, so as to avoid wasting donations, a real<br>open, fair, to be investigated.</p>
<p><strong>Gold Finance:</strong> in the current outbreak, your business is facing what<br>problem? Whether to start, whether normal operations, whether layoffs? (Cost,<br>cash flow problems, work problems) has taken measures to deal with?</p>
<p><strong>Gate.io wine children:</strong> we okay · The outbreak does not lead to the<br>enterprise started to work from home and other issues, but for us, not too<br>great . Because Gate.io has been using the globally distributed office<br>methods, the epidemic of overseas employees are not affected. During the<br>previous non-epidemic, many of our employees are also remote collaboration,<br>online office forms, so communication in the team, with respect, management<br>systems are relatively satisfactory. During the epidemic, the epidemic zone<br>everyone needs to cooperate with the national policy, actively carry out<br>protection work at home, but also have more time to focus on the market,<br>coupled with the recent market volatility is relatively large, so the user<br>transactions are increasing, Gate.io cash flow has been normal, GateChain team<br>is in constant recruitment of technical personnel, technical strength<br>enhancement.</p>
<p><strong>Gold Finance:</strong> in your observation, the block chain industry what changes<br>will have in the meantime? For many companies block chain security through the<br>epidemic, what advice do you have?  </p>
<p><strong>Gate.io wine children:</strong> to tell the truth, I really feel that this epidemic<br>has little effect on the block chain industry. After all, most employees are<br>not many, most of them technical staff. You can work from home. To mention a<br>few small suggestions it ·</p>
<p>1: go to the center of a large office is necessary. Initially block chain is<br>not solved trust it.</p>
<p>2: Point Club less soft mode, multi-point savings, happiness is only<br>temporary, no savings, would have been flustered ah, after all, many employees<br>still need money to buy daily necessities. You can not eat cake.</p>
<p>3: You do not know what tomorrow and the unexpected arrival of the first, good<br>property and backup important data.</p>
<p>4: The object is to find to find the object, the children have children, or<br>you see hold home for 20 days, and more boring.</p>
<p><strong>Gold Finance:</strong> Outlook 2020, you have expectations of how business and<br>block chain industry you are in?</p>
<p><strong>Gate.io wine children:</strong> at the beginning of 2020 is not very good, but does<br>not mean the end of good. In any case, the sense of, take every step ahead.<br>Come together duck</p>
<p><strong>Gold Finance:!</strong> below the epidemic, parties rush to the rescue Wuhan, your<br>business is mainly made of what action?  </p>
<p><strong>Gate.io wine children:</strong> was truly a bitter tears, find many twists and<br>turns. As a Pisces, especially when you encounter some can not understand,<br>even when people and things repeatedly stood up, tears could even not stop the<br>flow. Although the entire process somewhat difficult, but after everyone’s<br>efforts, the final result was very good.</p>
<p>So far, Gate.io official has donated masks only 2.5W (distributed to four<br>hospitals), disinfectant 1.7 tons (+ 8 hospitals assigned to a village),<br>medical gloves 6w only ( assigned to the six hospitals), goggles 200 (assigned<br>to three hospitals), 240 sets of protective clothing (assigned to three<br>hospitals) and designed for users send only 2w medical masks, masks user is<br>expected tomorrow, the day after being issued.</p>
