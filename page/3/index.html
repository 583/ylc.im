        <p>is a derivative continuity contract. From the perspective of the transaction,<br>it is similar to the traditional futures contracts, but there are some<br>differences. First, it is no expiration date or settlement, and sustainable<br>swaps similar to a margin spot market, so it is close to the trading price of<br>the underlying reference index price, unlike futures contracts, due to the<br>difference of the base, spread trading futures contracts There may be<br>significant differences. Second, the main mechanism for anchoring spot price<br>is the cost of funds.</p>
<p><strong>sustainable current contract main form is a rolling contract (Rolling Spot<br>Futures</strong> <strong>).</strong> is a rolling contract and the date of settlement of futures<br>contracts automatically renewed each day settlement gains and losses, traders<br>hold positions of contract will be automatically renewed at the end of the<br>trading day. In addition, there will be cash flow of assets to be exchanged,<br>the cost of funds to pay long short, short to compensate for the cost of<br>capital. Scroll contract is actually equivalent combination of automatic<br>renewal of contracts and the spot date of the currency swap, this product<br>originated in 1993, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (ChicagoMercantile<br>Exchange, CME) in order to avoid the huge cost of the underlying spot foreign<br>exchange settlement and the development of rolling contract, followed by the<br>emergence of gold rolling futures contracts and other varieties, mainly for<br>online retail market, serving small investors do not demand physical delivery.<br>Such contract relatively simple operation, without regard for positions<br>delivery and other steps required for professional investors is relatively<br>low, and the spot may be provided close to experience. Market mechanisms</p>
<p><strong>sustainable contract</strong></p>
<p>When trading futures contracts, traders need to understand the mechanisms of<br>several futures markets. A key part of traders should be noted that:  </p>
<p>fair price: sustainable use of swaps reasonable and fair price method.<br>Determine a fair price unrealized gains and losses and strong flat price.  </p>
<p>initial and maintenance margin: these critical margin levels determines how<br>much leverage can be used, and at what price would trigger a margin call.</p>
<p>capital costs: every eight hours regularly pay between buyer and seller. If<br>the rate is positive, the long positions and short positions will pay to<br>obtain funds rate, if the rate is negative, and vice versa. Please note that<br>you only hold positions in the capital timestamp, you only need to pay or<br>receive funding costs.</p>
<p>funds timestamp: 00: 00 (UTC + 8), 08: 00 (UTC + 8) and 16:00 (UTC + 8).<br>Traders can be found in the current funds rate contracts trading in the upper<br>right corner of the page. Similarly, you can also be found in this one rates<br>from the “Contract Details” in. Historical rates can be found in the funds<br>rate history.</p>
<p>perpetual contract for ordinary investors, in line with the concept of<br>decentralization of the block chain assets, for the status quo through the<br>card market, can prevent the accumulation of wear-sharing positions affect<br>investor expectations, increased market activity, facilitate arbitrage and<br>hedging, in favor of the introduction of institutional investors, and improve<br>market pricing mechanism. When</p>
<p>There is no limit perpetual contract term, sustainable arbitrage strategies to<br>use to perform the contract, contract delivery and do not worry about the<br>spread has not generated additional costs for positions expected to change<br>direction, can increase market pricing effectiveness. Hedging contracts to use<br>sustainable time can more easily select a hedging avoid wearing the cartridge<br>can not be assessed cumulatively hedging, or contract time is too short for<br>positions repeatedly.</p>
<p>number of mainstream online trading platform has been or is preparing for<br>perpetual contract products. December 19, 2018, the sustainable contract line<br>OKEx product currently supports BTC, ETH, EOS, LTC, XRP, BCH and TRX nine<br>varieties, this flagship product exchange agreement conforms to the trend of<br>sustainable contracts . The same month on the 24th, Gate.io on the line BTC<br>perpetual contract a firm offer, then gradually on the line ETH and other<br>varieties. After the December 2018 contract on the line product, Lan<br>Jianzhong, vice president Huobi Group, said in the future in order to meet<br>user demand will contract to launch sustainable products.</p>

        <p>golden Finance February 12 hearing on monetary encryption friendly attitude of<br>Chinese American presidential candidate Yang Anze (Andrew Yang), has announced<br>the withdrawal in 2020 elections. Yang Anze is a Taiwan-born American<br>entrepreneur, the American business (Venture for America), founder of the<br>organization, he was a Democratic primary candidate for the US presidential<br>election.</p>
<p><img src="/2020/02/13/575489/0.png" alt="RO8SeLAQRCcYyTDC4GtyH2J7iT9mx54EXgj7eaRk.jpeg"> According to Gold<br>Finance previously reported, Yang Anze is US presidential candidates, one of<br>the few strong supporter of encryption currency, he has many times in public,<br>even behind encryption currency, its campaign has also announced its<br>acceptance of BTC, ETH and any other standards-based ERC20 currency donations.</p>
<p>On the currency to be encrypted attitude, Yang Anze said in an interview with<br>Bloomberg News editor Joe • Weisenthal (Joe Weisenthal) interview that the<br>United States flawed encryption regulations, and many state regulations is not<br>conducive to innovation. About Joe • Weisenthal cited problems in the industry<br>on the “regulatory intends to limit capital inflows bit encryption coins and<br>other money market”, Yang Anze given the neutral answer, as long as he tried<br>to “Bitcoin” who know that no matter how strict supervision, and ultimately<br>can not impede, or prevent Bitcoin.</p>
<p>On the regulatory views on encryption currency, Yang Anze had recommended that<br>the regulations be updated to “unified national regulatory framework,” This<br>will not only increase the degree of innovation, but also improve regulatory<br>clarity, in his proposal He wrote: “investment currency encryption and digital<br>assets far beyond the uS regulatory framework, we should allow investors, both<br>individuals and businesses understand regulatory toward supporting the<br>development of innovative in dealing with the issue of the blocks. chain has<br>enormous potential. “</p>
<p>in addition, Yang Anze not only very supportive of encryption widely quoted in<br>the currency of the United States, he is also very respected block chain<br>technology. He was questioned on Twitter to respond to others, he said:.<br>“Block chain has enormous potential to make many things more transparent and<br>efficient” and an example application examples will be presented block chain<br>technology for the US presidential vote, he said: “Today, using chain blocks<br>on our phone anti-vote fraud, it is technically feasible to 100% of this<br>practice will completely change the existing voting system, and bring real<br>democracy, because all of the United States. people will participate in the<br>vote, no one can use smart phones the old system, it is not difficult to<br>achieve. “</p>
<p>perhaps Yang Anze US presidential race is not the most popular candidate, but<br>his exit, for encryption Currency industry is still a loss.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>This year is undoubtedly the most attention insiders is halved BTC and other<br>currencies, mostly concentrated in the time before and after May. I wonder if<br>we have not found, BCH’s time to cut about a month earlier than the BTC?</p>
<p>We know that BCH is forked out by the BTC, the characteristics of the two are<br>very similar in many aspects, such as total circulation is 21 million, 210,000<br>are cut every block. The production cuts this year, also occurred in the block<br>height 630 000. However, both production time, there is a big difference, and<br>why? Cause</p>
<p>are caused by two different times:</p>
<p>First, a block of time is random. Although theoretically such credits bits<br>illustrating a block every 10 minutes, but this is only a theoretical average<br>actual time of each block are random, short or long, not the average down time<br>10 minutes the whole . Therefore, we can roughly calculate Bitcoin cut<br>production time is about one day, but not precisely when a fraction of<br>seconds. Therefore, even when the BCH is identical with BTC chain, since a<br>random block of time, they cut the same time is almost impossible.</p>
<p>Second, BCH block a time faster than the BTC. As a bifurcation currency coins<br>in order to compete with the original, in the general performance<br>characteristics will be strengthened. BCH in order to provide a better deal<br>than the BTC performance, it will use a different technology routes, such as<br>expansion, difficulty algorithm. When BCH just forked born, because of the<br>relatively few supporters, the whole network operators force significantly<br>lower than the BTC, so the average time to block out more than 10 minutes.<br>Later, the difficulty of changing the BCH algorithm, down mining difficult to<br>resolve the crisis, the result is a success, but the impact of a block of time<br>is a faster, far less than the average time of 10 minutes, so the reach of the<br>block height ratio BTC block. This is the direct cause of BCH now cut faster<br>time than BTC about a month.</p>

        <p>In early 2020, the new coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan and at a very<br>fast speed spread quickly swept the country. State, local governments and<br>businesses have responded, to do its utmost to fight the epidemic. Pursue a<br>“block chain +” and better able to improve the social life of the project,<br>have begun to use technology, began to play a role in various fields.</p>
<p>ant ants gold dress block chain block chain launched platform, is committed to<br>contributing to the block chain in real industry landing. Related technology<br>has been put into court in Hangzhou Internet, ants gold dress public platform,<br>such as Lynx to use, covering charity, the source, the contract as evidence,<br>commodity block chain such as warehouse receipts.</p>
<p>In the fight against the epidemic, the ants block chain also had an<br>outstanding performance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>as evidence on the chain</strong></li>

<p>around the relief supplies have rushed to the front line to fight the<br>epidemic, but the face of the huge number of materials and far far enough<br>manpower statistics, in the process can not do transparency of information,<br>even if the synchronization, flexible mobilization frequent problems. This not<br>only seriously affect the efficiency of the fight against the epidemic, but<br>also to the public have some doubts about charity process.</p>
<p>At present, Alipay has been on-line information service platform for epidemic<br>prevention materials, with the travel search queries to see. It is reported<br>that Zhejiang Medical Materials Group has launched the first bills of material<br>needs, including medical masks, protective clothing, hats, and other work.<br>Epidemic prevention materials information service platform using the ant block<br>chain technology, led by the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Committee Wei,<br>by letter to the Office, the demand for materials, supplies, transportation<br>and other aspects of the information will be reviewed and the chain as<br>evidence.</p>
<p>With related technology to ensure the platform, relief supplies can be done at<br>any time to be investigated, traceable, and can not be tampered with. Various<br>places for the deployment of materials, use can also be synchronized to the<br>chain, easy to use and flexible deployment of materials.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alipay also provide a permanent force to the free block chain<br>operator epidemic related applet developers, special financial support.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>processing insurance claims</strong></li>

<p>during the outbreak, another treasure has been used to block chain management-<br>related coronavirus claim.</p>
<p>another treasure is a serious illness in 2018 Huzhugongji service Alipay App<br>on line members to encounter major diseases (in the range of 100 kinds) will<br>be eligible for 300,000 or 10 thousand dollars in guarantees gold, cost shared<br>by all members. Currently, mutual treasure novel coronavirus has been added to<br>the eligible diseases, a one-time maximum payment amount is about 100,000<br>yuan.</p>
<p>This is a fall application block chain in the insurance industry. Insurance,<br>welfare, and other areas crowdfunding has been the hardest hit by a crisis of<br>confidence, endless liar and a variety of tricks, so that the public again and<br>again sank. When the function has just launched another treasure, some people<br>questioned: potentially fraudulent situation will not occur?</p>
<p>block chain is referred to as a trusted machine, formal disclosure,<br>transparency, and other technical characteristics can not be altered, and<br>ensure that there will potentially fraudulent situation Repudiation occurs.<br>Always looking for the insurance company for reimbursement of hospitalization<br>expenses, you must first pay a lot of the list, then the insurance companies<br>to enter the complex review stage, lengthy process complicated not say, but<br>also a great human and material resources consumed.</p>
<p>No problem as long as the information submitted, the insurance company will<br>generally be reimbursed in accordance with the contract, of course, can not<br>rule out that some insurance companies will be a variety of reasons for<br>insurance coverage, causing mental burden on patients and their families.</p>
