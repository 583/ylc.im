        <p>golden Finance February 12 hearing on monetary encryption friendly attitude of<br>Chinese American presidential candidate Yang Anze (Andrew Yang), has announced<br>the withdrawal in 2020 elections. Yang Anze is a Taiwan-born American<br>entrepreneur, the American business (Venture for America), founder of the<br>organization, he was a Democratic primary candidate for the US presidential<br>election.</p>
<p><img src="/2020/02/13/575489/0.png" alt="RO8SeLAQRCcYyTDC4GtyH2J7iT9mx54EXgj7eaRk.jpeg"> According to Gold<br>Finance previously reported, Yang Anze is US presidential candidates, one of<br>the few strong supporter of encryption currency, he has many times in public,<br>even behind encryption currency, its campaign has also announced its<br>acceptance of BTC, ETH and any other standards-based ERC20 currency donations.</p>
<p>On the currency to be encrypted attitude, Yang Anze said in an interview with<br>Bloomberg News editor Joe • Weisenthal (Joe Weisenthal) interview that the<br>United States flawed encryption regulations, and many state regulations is not<br>conducive to innovation. About Joe • Weisenthal cited problems in the industry<br>on the “regulatory intends to limit capital inflows bit encryption coins and<br>other money market”, Yang Anze given the neutral answer, as long as he tried<br>to “Bitcoin” who know that no matter how strict supervision, and ultimately<br>can not impede, or prevent Bitcoin.</p>
<p>On the regulatory views on encryption currency, Yang Anze had recommended that<br>the regulations be updated to “unified national regulatory framework,” This<br>will not only increase the degree of innovation, but also improve regulatory<br>clarity, in his proposal He wrote: “investment currency encryption and digital<br>assets far beyond the uS regulatory framework, we should allow investors, both<br>individuals and businesses understand regulatory toward supporting the<br>development of innovative in dealing with the issue of the blocks. chain has<br>enormous potential. “</p>
<p>in addition, Yang Anze not only very supportive of encryption widely quoted in<br>the currency of the United States, he is also very respected block chain<br>technology. He was questioned on Twitter to respond to others, he said:.<br>“Block chain has enormous potential to make many things more transparent and<br>efficient” and an example application examples will be presented block chain<br>technology for the US presidential vote, he said: “Today, using chain blocks<br>on our phone anti-vote fraud, it is technically feasible to 100% of this<br>practice will completely change the existing voting system, and bring real<br>democracy, because all of the United States. people will participate in the<br>vote, no one can use smart phones the old system, it is not difficult to<br>achieve. “</p>
<p>perhaps Yang Anze US presidential race is not the most popular candidate, but<br>his exit, for encryption Currency industry is still a loss.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>This year is undoubtedly the most attention insiders is halved BTC and other<br>currencies, mostly concentrated in the time before and after May. I wonder if<br>we have not found, BCH’s time to cut about a month earlier than the BTC?</p>
<p>We know that BCH is forked out by the BTC, the characteristics of the two are<br>very similar in many aspects, such as total circulation is 21 million, 210,000<br>are cut every block. The production cuts this year, also occurred in the block<br>height 630 000. However, both production time, there is a big difference, and<br>why? Cause</p>
<p>are caused by two different times:</p>
<p>First, a block of time is random. Although theoretically such credits bits<br>illustrating a block every 10 minutes, but this is only a theoretical average<br>actual time of each block are random, short or long, not the average down time<br>10 minutes the whole . Therefore, we can roughly calculate Bitcoin cut<br>production time is about one day, but not precisely when a fraction of<br>seconds. Therefore, even when the BCH is identical with BTC chain, since a<br>random block of time, they cut the same time is almost impossible.</p>
<p>Second, BCH block a time faster than the BTC. As a bifurcation currency coins<br>in order to compete with the original, in the general performance<br>characteristics will be strengthened. BCH in order to provide a better deal<br>than the BTC performance, it will use a different technology routes, such as<br>expansion, difficulty algorithm. When BCH just forked born, because of the<br>relatively few supporters, the whole network operators force significantly<br>lower than the BTC, so the average time to block out more than 10 minutes.<br>Later, the difficulty of changing the BCH algorithm, down mining difficult to<br>resolve the crisis, the result is a success, but the impact of a block of time<br>is a faster, far less than the average time of 10 minutes, so the reach of the<br>block height ratio BTC block. This is the direct cause of BCH now cut faster<br>time than BTC about a month.</p>

    </h1>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>In early 2019, Ann currency restart Launchpad tide turned IEO, IEO launched<br>major exchanges follow suit, triggered a rise in currency platform for nearly<br>half a year.</p>
<p>came in February 2020, then there is a collective platform currency<br>transaction is a result of OKEx heavy news release yesterday, while on-line<br>public chain OKChain test network, DEX to the center of the trading platform<br>synchronized on-line. This time OKEx the first public disclosure of the<br>OKChain future direction and development of five eco OKChain related core<br>technology, at the same time announced the OKB’s future development plans.</p>
<p>Secondly, OKEx CEO Jay Hao on personal micro-Bo said, OKEx announced the<br>destruction of 700 million uncirculated OKB, and promised never to privately<br>issuance OKB, OKB hold currency card users can enjoy on map OKT OKChain issue,<br>and OKT will serve as the basis for OKChain pass card, the team will map<br>creation block Token100% according to the proportion of positions to OKB OKB<br>holders, the team will not do any reservations.</p>
<p>major platforms destroyed platform has a lot of money to see, deflation has<br>become a good platform for potential currency prices of many factors, the<br>destruction of the OKEx announced a one-time 700 million uncirculated OKB,<br>while planning for a long time before the public chain plans to obtain<br>substantial progress, two good two-pronged approach, called depth charges,<br>resulting in after yesterday news release OKB prices soaring moment, at the<br>same time the mainstream callback weak currency, rapid rise OKB more than 40%,<br>led by HT, BNB, MX platforms such as collective currency rise, HT was up more<br>than 20%, BNB rose more than 10%, fierce market reaction.</p>
<p>deflation at the same time, OKEx Another highlight is the announcement of the<br>proposed OKB holding money through card users can enjoy OKT OKChain mapping<br>issue, but as OKChain OKT on the basis of evidence, the team will be mapped to<br>the creation block Token100% OKB OKB holder according to the proportion of<br>positions. Which means OKB holders may obtain a scaled new token OKT OKchain<br>future releases, which stabilizes the OKB’s sell-off to some extent, become<br>the basis OKB prices.</p>
<p>continued delay in the test network is finally a reason for the heavy line of<br>the message. Three platforms, the currency in the public safety chain<br>developed rapidly, OKEx first announced the launch of its own chain OKChain<br>public in December 2018.</p>
<p>19 March, OKEx announced OKB is expected to go to the main network by the<br>ERC20 OKChain network in June, but June OKChain main network has not released<br>as scheduled. On October 19, OKEx chief strategy officer Xu Kun micro-Bo said,<br>OKChain test network will be on the line in early November, but in November,<br>also did not honor this commitment. The time came in February of this year,<br>postponed several times OKChain test network finally on the line.</p>
<p>quite follow the trend of recent major platform signs</p>
<p>OKB rose yesterday, other platforms such as currency HT, BNB, MX, etc. have<br>different levels of follow up. In OKB logic behind yesterday’s rise, the major<br>platform seems to be just around the corner, many similar moves.</p>
<p>After OKEx announced OKChain online test line, according to a recent gathering<br>of APP news shallot, global currency fire station the evening of February 10<br>announced that the, HT (Huobi Token) is the core currency assets fire<br>ecosystem, the recent chain will fire public money on-line test network,<br>combined with the upcoming release of fire public money chain to form a new<br>strategic layout, usher in a new rule.</p>
<p>Gate also on February 11 Release Notes About GateChain public chain and GT<br>regular upgrades and other issues, according to the official announcement,<br>Gate feedback optimal adjustment of the user based on GT rules, including but<br>not limited to the future reduction GT circulation. GateChain currently<br>developing smoothly, the next significantly improve network performance and<br>ability to resist risks versions, and will be before the second quarter of<br>2020 on the main line network.</p>
