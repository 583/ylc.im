        <p>is a derivative continuity contract. From the perspective of the transaction,<br>it is similar to the traditional futures contracts, but there are some<br>differences. First, it is no expiration date or settlement, and sustainable<br>swaps similar to a margin spot market, so it is close to the trading price of<br>the underlying reference index price, unlike futures contracts, due to the<br>difference of the base, spread trading futures contracts There may be<br>significant differences. Second, the main mechanism for anchoring spot price<br>is the cost of funds.</p>
<p><strong>sustainable current contract main form is a rolling contract (Rolling Spot<br>Futures</strong> <strong>).</strong> is a rolling contract and the date of settlement of futures<br>contracts automatically renewed each day settlement gains and losses, traders<br>hold positions of contract will be automatically renewed at the end of the<br>trading day. In addition, there will be cash flow of assets to be exchanged,<br>the cost of funds to pay long short, short to compensate for the cost of<br>capital. Scroll contract is actually equivalent combination of automatic<br>renewal of contracts and the spot date of the currency swap, this product<br>originated in 1993, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (ChicagoMercantile<br>Exchange, CME) in order to avoid the huge cost of the underlying spot foreign<br>exchange settlement and the development of rolling contract, followed by the<br>emergence of gold rolling futures contracts and other varieties, mainly for<br>online retail market, serving small investors do not demand physical delivery.<br>Such contract relatively simple operation, without regard for positions<br>delivery and other steps required for professional investors is relatively<br>low, and the spot may be provided close to experience. Market mechanisms</p>
<p><strong>sustainable contract</strong></p>
<p>When trading futures contracts, traders need to understand the mechanisms of<br>several futures markets. A key part of traders should be noted that:  </p>
<p>fair price: sustainable use of swaps reasonable and fair price method.<br>Determine a fair price unrealized gains and losses and strong flat price.  </p>
<p>initial and maintenance margin: these critical margin levels determines how<br>much leverage can be used, and at what price would trigger a margin call.</p>
<p>capital costs: every eight hours regularly pay between buyer and seller. If<br>the rate is positive, the long positions and short positions will pay to<br>obtain funds rate, if the rate is negative, and vice versa. Please note that<br>you only hold positions in the capital timestamp, you only need to pay or<br>receive funding costs.</p>
<p>funds timestamp: 00: 00 (UTC + 8), 08: 00 (UTC + 8) and 16:00 (UTC + 8).<br>Traders can be found in the current funds rate contracts trading in the upper<br>right corner of the page. Similarly, you can also be found in this one rates<br>from the “Contract Details” in. Historical rates can be found in the funds<br>rate history.</p>
<p>perpetual contract for ordinary investors, in line with the concept of<br>decentralization of the block chain assets, for the status quo through the<br>card market, can prevent the accumulation of wear-sharing positions affect<br>investor expectations, increased market activity, facilitate arbitrage and<br>hedging, in favor of the introduction of institutional investors, and improve<br>market pricing mechanism. When</p>
<p>There is no limit perpetual contract term, sustainable arbitrage strategies to<br>use to perform the contract, contract delivery and do not worry about the<br>spread has not generated additional costs for positions expected to change<br>direction, can increase market pricing effectiveness. Hedging contracts to use<br>sustainable time can more easily select a hedging avoid wearing the cartridge<br>can not be assessed cumulatively hedging, or contract time is too short for<br>positions repeatedly.</p>
<p>number of mainstream online trading platform has been or is preparing for<br>perpetual contract products. December 19, 2018, the sustainable contract line<br>OKEx product currently supports BTC, ETH, EOS, LTC, XRP, BCH and TRX nine<br>varieties, this flagship product exchange agreement conforms to the trend of<br>sustainable contracts . The same month on the 24th, Gate.io on the line BTC<br>perpetual contract a firm offer, then gradually on the line ETH and other<br>varieties. After the December 2018 contract on the line product, Lan<br>Jianzhong, vice president Huobi Group, said in the future in order to meet<br>user demand will contract to launch sustainable products.</p>

        <p>golden Finance February 12 hearing on monetary encryption friendly attitude of<br>Chinese American presidential candidate Yang Anze (Andrew Yang), has announced<br>the withdrawal in 2020 elections. Yang Anze is a Taiwan-born American<br>entrepreneur, the American business (Venture for America), founder of the<br>organization, he was a Democratic primary candidate for the US presidential<br>election.</p>
<p><img src="/2020/02/13/575489/0.png" alt="RO8SeLAQRCcYyTDC4GtyH2J7iT9mx54EXgj7eaRk.jpeg"> According to Gold<br>Finance previously reported, Yang Anze is US presidential candidates, one of<br>the few strong supporter of encryption currency, he has many times in public,<br>even behind encryption currency, its campaign has also announced its<br>acceptance of BTC, ETH and any other standards-based ERC20 currency donations.</p>
<p>On the currency to be encrypted attitude, Yang Anze said in an interview with<br>Bloomberg News editor Joe • Weisenthal (Joe Weisenthal) interview that the<br>United States flawed encryption regulations, and many state regulations is not<br>conducive to innovation. About Joe • Weisenthal cited problems in the industry<br>on the “regulatory intends to limit capital inflows bit encryption coins and<br>other money market”, Yang Anze given the neutral answer, as long as he tried<br>to “Bitcoin” who know that no matter how strict supervision, and ultimately<br>can not impede, or prevent Bitcoin.</p>
<p>On the regulatory views on encryption currency, Yang Anze had recommended that<br>the regulations be updated to “unified national regulatory framework,” This<br>will not only increase the degree of innovation, but also improve regulatory<br>clarity, in his proposal He wrote: “investment currency encryption and digital<br>assets far beyond the uS regulatory framework, we should allow investors, both<br>individuals and businesses understand regulatory toward supporting the<br>development of innovative in dealing with the issue of the blocks. chain has<br>enormous potential. “</p>
<p>in addition, Yang Anze not only very supportive of encryption widely quoted in<br>the currency of the United States, he is also very respected block chain<br>technology. He was questioned on Twitter to respond to others, he said:.<br>“Block chain has enormous potential to make many things more transparent and<br>efficient” and an example application examples will be presented block chain<br>technology for the US presidential vote, he said: “Today, using chain blocks<br>on our phone anti-vote fraud, it is technically feasible to 100% of this<br>practice will completely change the existing voting system, and bring real<br>democracy, because all of the United States. people will participate in the<br>vote, no one can use smart phones the old system, it is not difficult to<br>achieve. “</p>
<p>perhaps Yang Anze US presidential race is not the most popular candidate, but<br>his exit, for encryption Currency industry is still a loss.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>According to the latest bulletin OKEx, OKB in the future development plans<br>announced, OKEx destroyed OKB 700 million unissued. 2018, when the total<br>announced the release OKB 1.0 billion, an initial circulation of 300 million,<br>the announced 700 million OKB destroyed unreleased, on behalf of OKB<br>officially entered the era of absolute deflation, will also become the world’s<br>first full circulation the platform currency. In addition, the announcement<br>said, OKEx team will no longer be reserved OKB, OKB repurchase will be<br>completely destroyed from the secondary market repurchase. Meanwhile, OKEx<br>privately promised never to additional OKB. OKB migrate to smart Contract Code<br>later OKChain main network will remove the issuance.</p>
<p><strong>What is destroyed? How to destroy? Why should we destroy? After the<br>destruction of coins gone it?</strong></p>
<p>The so-called destruction is part of the currency in circulation permanently<br>removed from the market. Lock in on a coin has basically been completed<br>release (Lock release will increase the throughput) currency, the destruction<br>of means of direct digital circulation permanently reduced, that is a direct<br>result of deflation, price is obviously there for the money the more obvious<br>role in promoting.</p>
<p>There are two common ways to destroy the currency, into the black hole<br>address, or directly using a smart contract destroyed.</p>
<p>The so-called black hole, is to go to be swallowed, not even think about it,<br>the foreign call Eater Address, the very image. Black hole address is a<br>special address, so far no one has mastered their private key, the future is<br>almost impossible. Common example: a black hole address Bitcoin<br>1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE, as well as the Ethernet address black hole<br>Square 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000. Both addresses a lot of<br>wealth, but due to the nature of the currency encryption, brute of a private<br>address, but also the need from more than 37 times the power of 10-bit private<br>key focus money than the number of sand on Earth, one by one to try, just be<br>prohibitively difficult. So address into a black hole of money, equivalent to<br>almost destroyed, from the market in circulation permanently removed.  </p>
<p>This time, the destruction of the black hole OKB address:<br>0xff1ee8604f9ec9c3bb292633bb939321ae861b30.</p>
<p>So, why should the tokens to destroy it? The main reasons are the following:</p>
<p>1, the project uses a PoB consensus mechanism. PoB (Proof of Burn), burn proof<br>mechanism, namely to prove that the user inputs to the network by encrypting<br>the destruction of the currency, which was “mining” and the right to verify<br>the transaction. Burn (destroy) the more we have the greater the (virtual)<br>operator force.</p>
<p>2, reduce circulation, thereby increasing the value of the Token. The case of<br>supply and demand affect the price, other things being equal, to reduce the<br>supply, prices will rise. Some items will be destroyed by means of tokens,<br>reducing liquidity in the market, thus adding value to the token, such as<br>fire, coins, currency security, OKEx are regularly destroyed part of the<br>platform currency.</p>
<p>In addition, there are other reasons might be destroyed tokens, such as user<br>error or intentional tokens into the black hole address, or some intelligent<br>project contract default Gas burning address and so on.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>This year is undoubtedly the most attention insiders is halved BTC and other<br>currencies, mostly concentrated in the time before and after May. I wonder if<br>we have not found, BCH’s time to cut about a month earlier than the BTC?</p>
<p>We know that BCH is forked out by the BTC, the characteristics of the two are<br>very similar in many aspects, such as total circulation is 21 million, 210,000<br>are cut every block. The production cuts this year, also occurred in the block<br>height 630 000. However, both production time, there is a big difference, and<br>why? Cause</p>
<p>are caused by two different times:</p>
<p>First, a block of time is random. Although theoretically such credits bits<br>illustrating a block every 10 minutes, but this is only a theoretical average<br>actual time of each block are random, short or long, not the average down time<br>10 minutes the whole . Therefore, we can roughly calculate Bitcoin cut<br>production time is about one day, but not precisely when a fraction of<br>seconds. Therefore, even when the BCH is identical with BTC chain, since a<br>random block of time, they cut the same time is almost impossible.</p>
<p>Second, BCH block a time faster than the BTC. As a bifurcation currency coins<br>in order to compete with the original, in the general performance<br>characteristics will be strengthened. BCH in order to provide a better deal<br>than the BTC performance, it will use a different technology routes, such as<br>expansion, difficulty algorithm. When BCH just forked born, because of the<br>relatively few supporters, the whole network operators force significantly<br>lower than the BTC, so the average time to block out more than 10 minutes.<br>Later, the difficulty of changing the BCH algorithm, down mining difficult to<br>resolve the crisis, the result is a success, but the impact of a block of time<br>is a faster, far less than the average time of 10 minutes, so the reach of the<br>block height ratio BTC block. This is the direct cause of BCH now cut faster<br>time than BTC about a month.</p>
