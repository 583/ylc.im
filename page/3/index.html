    </h1>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>According to the latest bulletin OKEx, OKB in the future development plans<br>announced, OKEx destroyed OKB 700 million unissued. 2018, when the total<br>announced the release OKB 1.0 billion, an initial circulation of 300 million,<br>the announced 700 million OKB destroyed unreleased, on behalf of OKB<br>officially entered the era of absolute deflation, will also become the world’s<br>first full circulation the platform currency. In addition, the announcement<br>said, OKEx team will no longer be reserved OKB, OKB repurchase will be<br>completely destroyed from the secondary market repurchase. Meanwhile, OKEx<br>privately promised never to additional OKB. OKB migrate to smart Contract Code<br>later OKChain main network will remove the issuance.</p>
<p><strong>What is destroyed? How to destroy? Why should we destroy? After the<br>destruction of coins gone it?</strong></p>
<p>The so-called destruction is part of the currency in circulation permanently<br>removed from the market. Lock in on a coin has basically been completed<br>release (Lock release will increase the throughput) currency, the destruction<br>of means of direct digital circulation permanently reduced, that is a direct<br>result of deflation, price is obviously there for the money the more obvious<br>role in promoting.</p>
<p>There are two common ways to destroy the currency, into the black hole<br>address, or directly using a smart contract destroyed.</p>
<p>The so-called black hole, is to go to be swallowed, not even think about it,<br>the foreign call Eater Address, the very image. Black hole address is a<br>special address, so far no one has mastered their private key, the future is<br>almost impossible. Common example: a black hole address Bitcoin<br>1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE, as well as the Ethernet address black hole<br>Square 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000. Both addresses a lot of<br>wealth, but due to the nature of the currency encryption, brute of a private<br>address, but also the need from more than 37 times the power of 10-bit private<br>key focus money than the number of sand on Earth, one by one to try, just be<br>prohibitively difficult. So address into a black hole of money, equivalent to<br>almost destroyed, from the market in circulation permanently removed.  </p>
<p>This time, the destruction of the black hole OKB address:<br>0xff1ee8604f9ec9c3bb292633bb939321ae861b30.</p>
<p>So, why should the tokens to destroy it? The main reasons are the following:</p>
<p>1, the project uses a PoB consensus mechanism. PoB (Proof of Burn), burn proof<br>mechanism, namely to prove that the user inputs to the network by encrypting<br>the destruction of the currency, which was “mining” and the right to verify<br>the transaction. Burn (destroy) the more we have the greater the (virtual)<br>operator force.</p>
<p>2, reduce circulation, thereby increasing the value of the Token. The case of<br>supply and demand affect the price, other things being equal, to reduce the<br>supply, prices will rise. Some items will be destroyed by means of tokens,<br>reducing liquidity in the market, thus adding value to the token, such as<br>fire, coins, currency security, OKEx are regularly destroyed part of the<br>platform currency.</p>
<p>In addition, there are other reasons might be destroyed tokens, such as user<br>error or intentional tokens into the black hole address, or some intelligent<br>project contract default Gas burning address and so on.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>This year is undoubtedly the most attention insiders is halved BTC and other<br>currencies, mostly concentrated in the time before and after May. I wonder if<br>we have not found, BCH’s time to cut about a month earlier than the BTC?</p>
<p>We know that BCH is forked out by the BTC, the characteristics of the two are<br>very similar in many aspects, such as total circulation is 21 million, 210,000<br>are cut every block. The production cuts this year, also occurred in the block<br>height 630 000. However, both production time, there is a big difference, and<br>why? Cause</p>
<p>are caused by two different times:</p>
<p>First, a block of time is random. Although theoretically such credits bits<br>illustrating a block every 10 minutes, but this is only a theoretical average<br>actual time of each block are random, short or long, not the average down time<br>10 minutes the whole . Therefore, we can roughly calculate Bitcoin cut<br>production time is about one day, but not precisely when a fraction of<br>seconds. Therefore, even when the BCH is identical with BTC chain, since a<br>random block of time, they cut the same time is almost impossible.</p>
<p>Second, BCH block a time faster than the BTC. As a bifurcation currency coins<br>in order to compete with the original, in the general performance<br>characteristics will be strengthened. BCH in order to provide a better deal<br>than the BTC performance, it will use a different technology routes, such as<br>expansion, difficulty algorithm. When BCH just forked born, because of the<br>relatively few supporters, the whole network operators force significantly<br>lower than the BTC, so the average time to block out more than 10 minutes.<br>Later, the difficulty of changing the BCH algorithm, down mining difficult to<br>resolve the crisis, the result is a success, but the impact of a block of time<br>is a faster, far less than the average time of 10 minutes, so the reach of the<br>block height ratio BTC block. This is the direct cause of BCH now cut faster<br>time than BTC about a month.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>In early 2020, the new coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan and at a very<br>fast speed spread quickly swept the country. State, local governments and<br>businesses have responded, to do its utmost to fight the epidemic. Pursue a<br>“block chain +” and better able to improve the social life of the project,<br>have begun to use technology, began to play a role in various fields.</p>
<p>ant ants gold dress block chain block chain launched platform, is committed to<br>contributing to the block chain in real industry landing. Related technology<br>has been put into court in Hangzhou Internet, ants gold dress public platform,<br>such as Lynx to use, covering charity, the source, the contract as evidence,<br>commodity block chain such as warehouse receipts.</p>
<p>In the fight against the epidemic, the ants block chain also had an<br>outstanding performance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>as evidence on the chain</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>around the relief supplies have rushed to the front line to fight the<br>epidemic, but the face of the huge number of materials and far far enough<br>manpower statistics, in the process can not do transparency of information,<br>even if the synchronization, flexible mobilization frequent problems. This not<br>only seriously affect the efficiency of the fight against the epidemic, but<br>also to the public have some doubts about charity process.</p>
<p>At present, Alipay has been on-line information service platform for epidemic<br>prevention materials, with the travel search queries to see. It is reported<br>that Zhejiang Medical Materials Group has launched the first bills of material<br>needs, including medical masks, protective clothing, hats, and other work.<br>Epidemic prevention materials information service platform using the ant block<br>chain technology, led by the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Committee Wei,<br>by letter to the Office, the demand for materials, supplies, transportation<br>and other aspects of the information will be reviewed and the chain as<br>evidence.</p>
<p>With related technology to ensure the platform, relief supplies can be done at<br>any time to be investigated, traceable, and can not be tampered with. Various<br>places for the deployment of materials, use can also be synchronized to the<br>chain, easy to use and flexible deployment of materials.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alipay also provide a permanent force to the free block chain<br>operator epidemic related applet developers, special financial support.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>processing insurance claims</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>during the outbreak, another treasure has been used to block chain management-<br>related coronavirus claim.</p>
<p>another treasure is a serious illness in 2018 Huzhugongji service Alipay App<br>on line members to encounter major diseases (in the range of 100 kinds) will<br>be eligible for 300,000 or 10 thousand dollars in guarantees gold, cost shared<br>by all members. Currently, mutual treasure novel coronavirus has been added to<br>the eligible diseases, a one-time maximum payment amount is about 100,000<br>yuan.</p>
<p>This is a fall application block chain in the insurance industry. Insurance,<br>welfare, and other areas crowdfunding has been the hardest hit by a crisis of<br>confidence, endless liar and a variety of tricks, so that the public again and<br>again sank. When the function has just launched another treasure, some people<br>questioned: potentially fraudulent situation will not occur?</p>
<p>block chain is referred to as a trusted machine, formal disclosure,<br>transparency, and other technical characteristics can not be altered, and<br>ensure that there will potentially fraudulent situation Repudiation occurs.<br>Always looking for the insurance company for reimbursement of hospitalization<br>expenses, you must first pay a lot of the list, then the insurance companies<br>to enter the complex review stage, lengthy process complicated not say, but<br>also a great human and material resources consumed.</p>
<p>No problem as long as the information submitted, the insurance company will<br>generally be reimbursed in accordance with the contract, of course, can not<br>rule out that some insurance companies will be a variety of reasons for<br>insurance coverage, causing mental burden on patients and their families.</p>
<p>The block chain is to simply say that hospitals, insurance agencies, patients<br>and their families are placed in a circle, out of the hospital according to<br>the actual situation of patients found to comply with the requirements of the<br>insurance agencies, insurance funds in the smart contract paid automatically,<br>complete reimbursement. In this process, reducing the transparency of<br>information through the tedious process, but also to enforce the contract by<br>intelligence, to ensure that the rights of patients.</p>
<p>treasure each other on the insurance may not be a common sense, but the block<br>chain in which the role or less.</p>

        <p>halved currency, a concept noun recent rise, BTC, BCH, BSV, ETC is hot “money<br>in half.” It should be noted that the currency is not halved things a newborn.</p>
<p>For a certain understanding of the encryption currency friend, “halving the<br>money” is very easy to understand, is that the currency has halved mining<br>incentive mechanism design, They can be called halved currency.</p>
<p>further explanation, we must first understand what is mining reward half. Here<br>to Bitcoin for example, we know the total circulation of Bitcoins is 21<br>million, and so many Bitcoin is not issued all at once, but little by little<br>produce mining until all 21 million bitcoins being dug. Nakamoto Bitcoin<br>mining in the design, on the one hand to mobilize the enthusiasm of the early<br>miners, on the other hand to make Bitcoin become increasingly valuable<br>(currency price higher and higher), based on the principle of supply and<br>demand relationship between the design market every four years the mining<br>reward halving the rules. Bitcoin born in just the first four years, miners<br>dug after the success blocks available 50-bit coin reward; after the first<br>halved in 2012, successfully dug block reward, becomes 25; 2016 after the 2nd<br>half, reward becomes 12.5 Bitcoin. 2020 is the third year of halving Bitcoin,<br>after the May (estimated time) in half this year, mining reward will become<br>6.25.</p>
<p>in the past 11 years, half due to a bit after each increment on the market<br>reduction credits bit credits become more scarce, thus boosting its prices. In<br>the past two encryption money market bull market, it has tied up with the<br>association halved Bitcoin. So after halving the price rise caused by<br>currency, also known as “halving the market.”</p>
<p>May 2020 (estimated), the third time in half a year mining reward Bitcoin,<br>people’s expectations that this will bring new Bitcoin round of the bull<br>market. Because it is directly related to the miners, investors and other<br>participants in pocket money, as much attention.</p>
<p>Further, after the birth of numerous credits bit encryption imitate it<br>currency, credits and bifurcated by a bit from the bifurcated credits, many of<br>them also used “halved” design, but not necessarily four years halved once,<br>not necessarily reduce by half the reward (such as ETC rate cut this year only<br>20%).</p>
<p>By 2020, many encryption currency Bitcoin follow, have chosen to be halved<br>this year, removing the currently most influential Bitcoin, concern high BCH,<br>BSV, eTC and other currencies, as well as dozens of smaller coins have chosen<br>to be halved by 2020. Therefore, in 2020, also known as the halving.</p>
<p>It is expected that this year is likely to usher in a new wave of the bull<br>market, current market conditions also support this expectation. But this is<br>not absolute, because the encryption in the currency market after ten years of<br>development, become more complex, more and more factors that affect the value<br>of the currency, how much influence halve the effect of actually left, is not<br>known.</p>

        <p>DeFi represent? Representatives of decentralized finance. What is based on the<br>bull market, secondary market prices rose, both of which seem close, but the<br>fact that this happened to you?</p>
<p>DeFi also known as Open Financial can provide a set of tools that enable<br>anyone around the world can participate in the financial services, while<br>retaining the assets in question the fully managed. So basically do not trust<br>DeFi interactive way to solve the central point of financial products.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.jinse.com/2943600" alt="UnSDNLcyMvkdEKv2rbgtXEzMh4owKz9ULsWs1fKq.png"></p>
<p><em>Defi current item type</em><br>DeFi most projects use Web 3 purse, e.g. Metamask, Ledger or Coinbase wallet .<br>Simply create your own wallet, and then the transfer of assets to support<br>digital wallets can be used. Because the smart token and a standard contract,<br>Ethernet Square has quickly become DeFi implementation platform. In addition,<br>Ethernet Square has the most active developers and established a foundation<br>wallet, exchanges and communities on this basis.</p>
<p>This reminds us of the commitment of the currency encryption, encryption is<br>the currency that everyone can make money and pay for widespread use, no<br>matter where they live. So DeFi practice path encryption currency. If DeFi<br>further. DeFi will be open for today’s world anyone can access the connected<br>global financial services used today (savings, loans, trading, insurance,<br>etc.) through smart phones and the Internet.</p>
<p>Now, smart contract developers a more complicated than the transmission and<br>reception of encrypted money function. It will form what we call dapps. So<br>there have been many attempts to be innovative areas, such as the world auto<br>loans reached directly between two strangers in different regions, with no<br>bank.</p>
<p>the difference between these DeFi dapp traditional banking or financial<br>industry, what is? The bull market was going to help the industry do?</p>
<p>core DeFi still is to the center, the core of these services is not determined<br>by institutional management, but by intelligent contract to write the rules.<br>Then contract to deploy smart block chain can run without human intervention.</p>
<p>code block chain on the transparent, anyone can check. More importantly, do<br>not need permission, “license-free” to create a “license-free” can<br>participate. Anyone can create DeFi application, use DeFi application.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we find that, DeFi represent the industry in the application<br>layer to the financial daily, for the industry, it can improve efficiency, but<br>the system limit may not be able to be applied to reality.</p>
<p>bull market demand, mainly from the secondary market cycle, most of the<br>decisions on supply and demand, if the Defi is to help the emergence of<br>financial applications, but can only increase the number of tokens used, but<br>there is not the direct cause prices to be determined. Even though many DeFi<br>taken a pledge mode, it can help reduce market liquidity, but also a<br>comprehensive financial options. But this is precisely also become a deadly<br>obstacle.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.jinse.com/2943603" alt="mQOYMQSP1q5LgRgqmp7XZeOX64sTOmqSuS55A2DQ.png"><br>DeFi rely heavily on collateral as a guarantee. Money needs to be encrypted to<br>provide collateral in order to borrow more money encryption. The traditional<br>unsecured loans need to rely on identity, so that borrowers can establish<br>credit and to increase their lending capacity, but with today’s identity and<br>credit systems, decentralized identity must be both versatile and have privacy<br>protection.</p>
<p>and mortgage lending, there is this big security risk, DeFi Black Swan is a<br>smart contract loophole. If hackers to find and exploit the dapp open source<br>code errors, the result of the system is devastating.</p>
<p>these, as a service industry, users will experience a leather Defi life.</p>
<p>So, if we expect the bull market, or DeFi development driven bull market or<br>become the basis of a bull market, which is to be expected but can not be<br>achieved in a short time. 2019 Defi developed rapidly, if possible large-scale<br>commercial Defi in 2020, maybe 2020 can also set up the bull market of the<br>substance of a two-stage basis. Otherwise, when the market turns Bear, Defi<br>will be like wallet, it faces massive eliminated.</p>
<p>from the property point of view, in fact, can be understood as the encrypted<br>monetary latest digital incarnation. In the next few years, we may see a shift<br>to financial services are encrypted ecosystem. Now the product will cover the<br>distribution and exchange of assets, loans, trust, and other derivatives.</p>
<p>But the financial industry as a necessary tool for each, there is an<br>inevitable need for innovation and inevitable, block chain technology has been<br>recognized by the financial industry, money can be fully encrypted look<br>forward to.</p>
