<p>With the technology development in recent years, such as encryption currency<br>and international financial markets, interoperability, resulting in<br>increasingly sophisticated criminal organizations and terrorist financing<br>financial electronic crimes. So 2021 budget proposed legislation will be<br>reclassified back to the United States Secret Service, the US Treasury<br>Department to expand the scope of regulation encryption currency US Treasury,<br><strong>to the criminal acts involving encryption currency and financial markets of<br>the survey “create new efficiencies.” .</strong></p>
<p>The United States of the 2021 budget is also prepared to strengthen the<br>prevention of financial crimes, monitoring and investigation. This part of the<br>duties of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) led by US<br>financial institutions, regulators in charge of the discovery and prosecution<br>of money laundering threat to the United States and other scams. 2020 FinCEN<br>will allocate $ 127 million to prevent terrorist financing, money laundering<br>and other financial crimes, <strong>and virtual currency and emerging network<br>security threats and fight.</strong></p>
<p>There is also a counter-terrorism under the Ministry of Finance Financial<br>Intelligence Office (Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence), is also<br>responsible for the fight against terrorism, rogue regimes, etc., mainly so<br>that they can not use the United States dominated financial system, so as to<br>allow them to financial bankruptcy. The office is also investing in the<br>development of certain financial instruments, help enhance the ability to<br>encrypt money laundering and terrorist financing to deal with the emerging<br>behavior. 2020 will give the Financial Intelligence Office counter-terrorism<br>appropriation of $ 173 million, an increase of 40 percent compared to last<br>year.</p>
<p>said so much, in the end how much encryption currency crime have it? Well-<br>known encryption currency intelligence analysts Chainalysis just released 2019<br>crime report encryption currency in January, you might be able to tell people<br>the answer.</p>
<p>Chainalysis report summarizes the hacking scam encryption and encryption<br>currency Crime. The number of encryption currency hacker attacks occurred in<br>2019 than in any previous year, the increase in the number of attacks, but in<br>exchange the total value of the stolen money to encrypt only $ 283 million.</p>
<p>2019 years, a variety of encryption scam caused a total loss of $ 4.3 billion,<br>but most scams are related to the Ponzi scheme, the $ 4.3 billion in mostly<br>from PlusToken and OneCoin two large Pang Ponzi scheme, if you remove these,<br>the total amount of fraud encryption will encrypt only 0.46% of all monetary<br>activities. Scammers rely mainly on the exchange to honor their ill-gotten<br>gains, these encryption money illegally obtained 57.6% complete transactions<br>through money laundering OTC on the exchange.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>This year is undoubtedly the most attention insiders is halved BTC and other<br>currencies, mostly concentrated in the time before and after May. I wonder if<br>we have not found, BCH’s time to cut about a month earlier than the BTC?</p>
<p>We know that BCH is forked out by the BTC, the characteristics of the two are<br>very similar in many aspects, such as total circulation is 21 million, 210,000<br>are cut every block. The production cuts this year, also occurred in the block<br>height 630 000. However, both production time, there is a big difference, and<br>why? Cause</p>
<p>are caused by two different times:</p>
<p>First, a block of time is random. Although theoretically such credits bits<br>illustrating a block every 10 minutes, but this is only a theoretical average<br>actual time of each block are random, short or long, not the average down time<br>10 minutes the whole . Therefore, we can roughly calculate Bitcoin cut<br>production time is about one day, but not precisely when a fraction of<br>seconds. Therefore, even when the BCH is identical with BTC chain, since a<br>random block of time, they cut the same time is almost impossible.</p>
<p>Second, BCH block a time faster than the BTC. As a bifurcation currency coins<br>in order to compete with the original, in the general performance<br>characteristics will be strengthened. BCH in order to provide a better deal<br>than the BTC performance, it will use a different technology routes, such as<br>expansion, difficulty algorithm. When BCH just forked born, because of the<br>relatively few supporters, the whole network operators force significantly<br>lower than the BTC, so the average time to block out more than 10 minutes.<br>Later, the difficulty of changing the BCH algorithm, down mining difficult to<br>resolve the crisis, the result is a success, but the impact of a block of time<br>is a faster, far less than the average time of 10 minutes, so the reach of the<br>block height ratio BTC block. This is the direct cause of BCH now cut faster<br>time than BTC about a month.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>In early 2019, Ann currency restart Launchpad tide turned IEO, IEO launched<br>major exchanges follow suit, triggered a rise in currency platform for nearly<br>half a year.</p>
<p>came in February 2020, then there is a collective platform currency<br>transaction is a result of OKEx heavy news release yesterday, while on-line<br>public chain OKChain test network, DEX to the center of the trading platform<br>synchronized on-line. This time OKEx the first public disclosure of the<br>OKChain future direction and development of five eco OKChain related core<br>technology, at the same time announced the OKB’s future development plans.</p>
<p>Secondly, OKEx CEO Jay Hao on personal micro-Bo said, OKEx announced the<br>destruction of 700 million uncirculated OKB, and promised never to privately<br>issuance OKB, OKB hold currency card users can enjoy on map OKT OKChain issue,<br>and OKT will serve as the basis for OKChain pass card, the team will map<br>creation block Token100% according to the proportion of positions to OKB OKB<br>holders, the team will not do any reservations.</p>
<p>major platforms destroyed platform has a lot of money to see, deflation has<br>become a good platform for potential currency prices of many factors, the<br>destruction of the OKEx announced a one-time 700 million uncirculated OKB,<br>while planning for a long time before the public chain plans to obtain<br>substantial progress, two good two-pronged approach, called depth charges,<br>resulting in after yesterday news release OKB prices soaring moment, at the<br>same time the mainstream callback weak currency, rapid rise OKB more than 40%,<br>led by HT, BNB, MX platforms such as collective currency rise, HT was up more<br>than 20%, BNB rose more than 10%, fierce market reaction.</p>
<p>deflation at the same time, OKEx Another highlight is the announcement of the<br>proposed OKB holding money through card users can enjoy OKT OKChain mapping<br>issue, but as OKChain OKT on the basis of evidence, the team will be mapped to<br>the creation block Token100% OKB OKB holder according to the proportion of<br>positions. Which means OKB holders may obtain a scaled new token OKT OKchain<br>future releases, which stabilizes the OKB’s sell-off to some extent, become<br>the basis OKB prices.</p>
<p>continued delay in the test network is finally a reason for the heavy line of<br>the message. Three platforms, the currency in the public safety chain<br>developed rapidly, OKEx first announced the launch of its own chain OKChain<br>public in December 2018.</p>
<p>19 March, OKEx announced OKB is expected to go to the main network by the<br>ERC20 OKChain network in June, but June OKChain main network has not released<br>as scheduled. On October 19, OKEx chief strategy officer Xu Kun micro-Bo said,<br>OKChain test network will be on the line in early November, but in November,<br>also did not honor this commitment. The time came in February of this year,<br>postponed several times OKChain test network finally on the line.</p>
<p>quite follow the trend of recent major platform signs</p>
<p>OKB rose yesterday, other platforms such as currency HT, BNB, MX, etc. have<br>different levels of follow up. In OKB logic behind yesterday’s rise, the major<br>platform seems to be just around the corner, many similar moves.</p>
<p>After OKEx announced OKChain online test line, according to a recent gathering<br>of APP news shallot, global currency fire station the evening of February 10<br>announced that the, HT (Huobi Token) is the core currency assets fire<br>ecosystem, the recent chain will fire public money on-line test network,<br>combined with the upcoming release of fire public money chain to form a new<br>strategic layout, usher in a new rule.</p>
<p>Gate also on February 11 Release Notes About GateChain public chain and GT<br>regular upgrades and other issues, according to the official announcement,<br>Gate feedback optimal adjustment of the user based on GT rules, including but<br>not limited to the future reduction GT circulation. GateChain currently<br>developing smoothly, the next significantly improve network performance and<br>ability to resist risks versions, and will be before the second quarter of<br>2020 on the main line network.</p>
<p>destruction regard, following OKEx announced the destruction of 700 million<br>uncirculated OKB, ZB February 10 announced its decision to permanently destroy<br>the total cumulative 1.4 billion ZB, announced that the following ZB has one<br>billion dollars, the official currency team to give up all the team held 293<br>million ZB currency and permanently destroyed, and the destruction of 107<br>million RMB ZB user security fund, as of now, a total of 1.4 billion ZB<br>destruction, ZB currency for the destruction of all subsequent takeover by the<br>platform from the secondary market, and direct destruction, no longer in the<br>user security funds (total circulation can be modified when less than a<br>certain number of regulations and otherwise advance notice). So far, ZB will<br>enter the absolute number of deflationary phase.</p>
<p>FCoin also subsequently announced the permanent destruction of all the FT team<br>holds (about 700 million), which announced that following the referendum a<br>year ago for the first time based on FCoin community after the result of the<br>destruction of all the unreleased part of the FT (total 5,044,114,837.92336501<br>FT), now FCoin team decided to team (FCoin team) holds all of the FT (a total<br>of 720,404,905.38 FT) permanently destroyed. Destruction will be completed<br>today.</p>
<p>seen in the wake of the wave of IEO, the new year, the major platform seems to<br>have found a new platform to enhance the value of the currency of tricks,<br>whether to replicate last year’s peak, He is waiting for the flowers.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>According to the latest bulletin OKEx, OKB in the future development plans<br>announced, OKEx destroyed OKB 700 million unissued. 2018, when the total<br>announced the release OKB 1.0 billion, an initial circulation of 300 million,<br>the announced 700 million OKB destroyed unreleased, on behalf of OKB<br>officially entered the era of absolute deflation, will also become the world’s<br>first full circulation the platform currency. In addition, the announcement<br>said, OKEx team will no longer be reserved OKB, OKB repurchase will be<br>completely destroyed from the secondary market repurchase. Meanwhile, OKEx<br>privately promised never to additional OKB. OKB migrate to smart Contract Code<br>later OKChain main network will remove the issuance.</p>
<p><strong>What is destroyed? How to destroy? Why should we destroy? After the<br>destruction of coins gone it?</strong></p>
<p>The so-called destruction is part of the currency in circulation permanently<br>removed from the market. Lock in on a coin has basically been completed<br>release (Lock release will increase the throughput) currency, the destruction<br>of means of direct digital circulation permanently reduced, that is a direct<br>result of deflation, price is obviously there for the money the more obvious<br>role in promoting.</p>
<p>There are two common ways to destroy the currency, into the black hole<br>address, or directly using a smart contract destroyed.</p>
<p>The so-called black hole, is to go to be swallowed, not even think about it,<br>the foreign call Eater Address, the very image. Black hole address is a<br>special address, so far no one has mastered their private key, the future is<br>almost impossible. Common example: a black hole address Bitcoin<br>1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE, as well as the Ethernet address black hole<br>Square 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000. Both addresses a lot of<br>wealth, but due to the nature of the currency encryption, brute of a private<br>address, but also the need from more than 37 times the power of 10-bit private<br>key focus money than the number of sand on Earth, one by one to try, just be<br>prohibitively difficult. So address into a black hole of money, equivalent to<br>almost destroyed, from the market in circulation permanently removed.  </p>
<p>This time, the destruction of the black hole OKB address:<br>0xff1ee8604f9ec9c3bb292633bb939321ae861b30.</p>
<p>So, why should the tokens to destroy it? The main reasons are the following:</p>
<p>1, the project uses a PoB consensus mechanism. PoB (Proof of Burn), burn proof<br>mechanism, namely to prove that the user inputs to the network by encrypting<br>the destruction of the currency, which was “mining” and the right to verify<br>the transaction. Burn (destroy) the more we have the greater the (virtual)<br>operator force.</p>
<p>2, reduce circulation, thereby increasing the value of the Token. The case of<br>supply and demand affect the price, other things being equal, to reduce the<br>supply, prices will rise. Some items will be destroyed by means of tokens,<br>reducing liquidity in the market, thus adding value to the token, such as<br>fire, coins, currency security, OKEx are regularly destroyed part of the<br>platform currency.</p>
<p>In addition, there are other reasons might be destroyed tokens, such as user<br>error or intentional tokens into the black hole address, or some intelligent<br>project contract default Gas burning address and so on.</p>
