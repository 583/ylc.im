    </h1>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>In early 2019, Ann currency restart Launchpad tide turned IEO, IEO launched<br>major exchanges follow suit, triggered a rise in currency platform for nearly<br>half a year.</p>
<p>came in February 2020, then there is a collective platform currency<br>transaction is a result of OKEx heavy news release yesterday, while on-line<br>public chain OKChain test network, DEX to the center of the trading platform<br>synchronized on-line. This time OKEx the first public disclosure of the<br>OKChain future direction and development of five eco OKChain related core<br>technology, at the same time announced the OKB’s future development plans.</p>
<p>Secondly, OKEx CEO Jay Hao on personal micro-Bo said, OKEx announced the<br>destruction of 700 million uncirculated OKB, and promised never to privately<br>issuance OKB, OKB hold currency card users can enjoy on map OKT OKChain issue,<br>and OKT will serve as the basis for OKChain pass card, the team will map<br>creation block Token100% according to the proportion of positions to OKB OKB<br>holders, the team will not do any reservations.</p>
<p>major platforms destroyed platform has a lot of money to see, deflation has<br>become a good platform for potential currency prices of many factors, the<br>destruction of the OKEx announced a one-time 700 million uncirculated OKB,<br>while planning for a long time before the public chain plans to obtain<br>substantial progress, two good two-pronged approach, called depth charges,<br>resulting in after yesterday news release OKB prices soaring moment, at the<br>same time the mainstream callback weak currency, rapid rise OKB more than 40%,<br>led by HT, BNB, MX platforms such as collective currency rise, HT was up more<br>than 20%, BNB rose more than 10%, fierce market reaction.</p>
<p>deflation at the same time, OKEx Another highlight is the announcement of the<br>proposed OKB holding money through card users can enjoy OKT OKChain mapping<br>issue, but as OKChain OKT on the basis of evidence, the team will be mapped to<br>the creation block Token100% OKB OKB holder according to the proportion of<br>positions. Which means OKB holders may obtain a scaled new token OKT OKchain<br>future releases, which stabilizes the OKB’s sell-off to some extent, become<br>the basis OKB prices.</p>
<p>continued delay in the test network is finally a reason for the heavy line of<br>the message. Three platforms, the currency in the public safety chain<br>developed rapidly, OKEx first announced the launch of its own chain OKChain<br>public in December 2018.</p>
<p>19 March, OKEx announced OKB is expected to go to the main network by the<br>ERC20 OKChain network in June, but June OKChain main network has not released<br>as scheduled. On October 19, OKEx chief strategy officer Xu Kun micro-Bo said,<br>OKChain test network will be on the line in early November, but in November,<br>also did not honor this commitment. The time came in February of this year,<br>postponed several times OKChain test network finally on the line.</p>
<p>quite follow the trend of recent major platform signs</p>
<p>OKB rose yesterday, other platforms such as currency HT, BNB, MX, etc. have<br>different levels of follow up. In OKB logic behind yesterday’s rise, the major<br>platform seems to be just around the corner, many similar moves.</p>
<p>After OKEx announced OKChain online test line, according to a recent gathering<br>of APP news shallot, global currency fire station the evening of February 10<br>announced that the, HT (Huobi Token) is the core currency assets fire<br>ecosystem, the recent chain will fire public money on-line test network,<br>combined with the upcoming release of fire public money chain to form a new<br>strategic layout, usher in a new rule.</p>
<p>Gate also on February 11 Release Notes About GateChain public chain and GT<br>regular upgrades and other issues, according to the official announcement,<br>Gate feedback optimal adjustment of the user based on GT rules, including but<br>not limited to the future reduction GT circulation. GateChain currently<br>developing smoothly, the next significantly improve network performance and<br>ability to resist risks versions, and will be before the second quarter of<br>2020 on the main line network.</p>
<p>destruction regard, following OKEx announced the destruction of 700 million<br>uncirculated OKB, ZB February 10 announced its decision to permanently destroy<br>the total cumulative 1.4 billion ZB, announced that the following ZB has one<br>billion dollars, the official currency team to give up all the team held 293<br>million ZB currency and permanently destroyed, and the destruction of 107<br>million RMB ZB user security fund, as of now, a total of 1.4 billion ZB<br>destruction, ZB currency for the destruction of all subsequent takeover by the<br>platform from the secondary market, and direct destruction, no longer in the<br>user security funds (total circulation can be modified when less than a<br>certain number of regulations and otherwise advance notice). So far, ZB will<br>enter the absolute number of deflationary phase.</p>
<p>FCoin also subsequently announced the permanent destruction of all the FT team<br>holds (about 700 million), which announced that following the referendum a<br>year ago for the first time based on FCoin community after the result of the<br>destruction of all the unreleased part of the FT (total 5,044,114,837.92336501<br>FT), now FCoin team decided to team (FCoin team) holds all of the FT (a total<br>of 720,404,905.38 FT) permanently destroyed. Destruction will be completed<br>today.</p>
<p>seen in the wake of the wave of IEO, the new year, the major platform seems to<br>have found a new platform to enhance the value of the currency of tricks,<br>whether to replicate last year’s peak, He is waiting for the flowers.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>DeFi represent? Representatives of decentralized finance. What is based on the<br>bull market, secondary market prices rose, both of which seem close, but the<br>fact that this happened to you?</p>
<p>DeFi also known as Open Financial can provide a set of tools that enable<br>anyone around the world can participate in the financial services, while<br>retaining the assets in question the fully managed. So basically do not trust<br>DeFi interactive way to solve the central point of financial products.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.jinse.com/2943600" alt="UnSDNLcyMvkdEKv2rbgtXEzMh4owKz9ULsWs1fKq.png"></p>
<p><em>Defi current item type</em><br>DeFi most projects use Web 3 purse, e.g. Metamask, Ledger or Coinbase wallet .<br>Simply create your own wallet, and then the transfer of assets to support<br>digital wallets can be used. Because the smart token and a standard contract,<br>Ethernet Square has quickly become DeFi implementation platform. In addition,<br>Ethernet Square has the most active developers and established a foundation<br>wallet, exchanges and communities on this basis.</p>
<p>This reminds us of the commitment of the currency encryption, encryption is<br>the currency that everyone can make money and pay for widespread use, no<br>matter where they live. So DeFi practice path encryption currency. If DeFi<br>further. DeFi will be open for today’s world anyone can access the connected<br>global financial services used today (savings, loans, trading, insurance,<br>etc.) through smart phones and the Internet.</p>
<p>Now, smart contract developers a more complicated than the transmission and<br>reception of encrypted money function. It will form what we call dapps. So<br>there have been many attempts to be innovative areas, such as the world auto<br>loans reached directly between two strangers in different regions, with no<br>bank.</p>
<p>the difference between these DeFi dapp traditional banking or financial<br>industry, what is? The bull market was going to help the industry do?</p>
<p>core DeFi still is to the center, the core of these services is not determined<br>by institutional management, but by intelligent contract to write the rules.<br>Then contract to deploy smart block chain can run without human intervention.</p>
<p>code block chain on the transparent, anyone can check. More importantly, do<br>not need permission, “license-free” to create a “license-free” can<br>participate. Anyone can create DeFi application, use DeFi application.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we find that, DeFi represent the industry in the application<br>layer to the financial daily, for the industry, it can improve efficiency, but<br>the system limit may not be able to be applied to reality.</p>
<p>bull market demand, mainly from the secondary market cycle, most of the<br>decisions on supply and demand, if the Defi is to help the emergence of<br>financial applications, but can only increase the number of tokens used, but<br>there is not the direct cause prices to be determined. Even though many DeFi<br>taken a pledge mode, it can help reduce market liquidity, but also a<br>comprehensive financial options. But this is precisely also become a deadly<br>obstacle.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.jinse.com/2943603" alt="mQOYMQSP1q5LgRgqmp7XZeOX64sTOmqSuS55A2DQ.png"><br>DeFi rely heavily on collateral as a guarantee. Money needs to be encrypted to<br>provide collateral in order to borrow more money encryption. The traditional<br>unsecured loans need to rely on identity, so that borrowers can establish<br>credit and to increase their lending capacity, but with today’s identity and<br>credit systems, decentralized identity must be both versatile and have privacy<br>protection.</p>
<p>and mortgage lending, there is this big security risk, DeFi Black Swan is a<br>smart contract loophole. If hackers to find and exploit the dapp open source<br>code errors, the result of the system is devastating.</p>
<p>these, as a service industry, users will experience a leather Defi life.</p>
<p>So, if we expect the bull market, or DeFi development driven bull market or<br>become the basis of a bull market, which is to be expected but can not be<br>achieved in a short time. 2019 Defi developed rapidly, if possible large-scale<br>commercial Defi in 2020, maybe 2020 can also set up the bull market of the<br>substance of a two-stage basis. Otherwise, when the market turns Bear, Defi<br>will be like wallet, it faces massive eliminated.</p>
<p>from the property point of view, in fact, can be understood as the encrypted<br>monetary latest digital incarnation. In the next few years, we may see a shift<br>to financial services are encrypted ecosystem. Now the product will cover the<br>distribution and exchange of assets, loans, trust, and other derivatives.</p>
<p>But the financial industry as a necessary tool for each, there is an<br>inevitable need for innovation and inevitable, block chain technology has been<br>recognized by the financial industry, money can be fully encrypted look<br>forward to.</p>

    </h1>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>This year is undoubtedly the most attention insiders is halved BTC and other<br>currencies, mostly concentrated in the time before and after May. I wonder if<br>we have not found, BCH’s time to cut about a month earlier than the BTC?</p>
<p>We know that BCH is forked out by the BTC, the characteristics of the two are<br>very similar in many aspects, such as total circulation is 21 million, 210,000<br>are cut every block. The production cuts this year, also occurred in the block<br>height 630 000. However, both production time, there is a big difference, and<br>why? Cause</p>
<p>are caused by two different times:</p>
<p>First, a block of time is random. Although theoretically such credits bits<br>illustrating a block every 10 minutes, but this is only a theoretical average<br>actual time of each block are random, short or long, not the average down time<br>10 minutes the whole . Therefore, we can roughly calculate Bitcoin cut<br>production time is about one day, but not precisely when a fraction of<br>seconds. Therefore, even when the BCH is identical with BTC chain, since a<br>random block of time, they cut the same time is almost impossible.</p>
<p>Second, BCH block a time faster than the BTC. As a bifurcation currency coins<br>in order to compete with the original, in the general performance<br>characteristics will be strengthened. BCH in order to provide a better deal<br>than the BTC performance, it will use a different technology routes, such as<br>expansion, difficulty algorithm. When BCH just forked born, because of the<br>relatively few supporters, the whole network operators force significantly<br>lower than the BTC, so the average time to block out more than 10 minutes.<br>Later, the difficulty of changing the BCH algorithm, down mining difficult to<br>resolve the crisis, the result is a success, but the impact of a block of time<br>is a faster, far less than the average time of 10 minutes, so the reach of the<br>block height ratio BTC block. This is the direct cause of BCH now cut faster<br>time than BTC about a month.</p>

<p>said so much, in the end how much encryption currency crime have it? Well-<br>known encryption currency intelligence analysts Chainalysis just released 2019<br>crime report encryption currency in January, you might be able to tell people<br>the answer.</p>
<p>Chainalysis report summarizes the hacking scam encryption and encryption<br>currency Crime. The number of encryption currency hacker attacks occurred in<br>2019 than in any previous year, the increase in the number of attacks, but in<br>exchange the total value of the stolen money to encrypt only $ 283 million.</p>

        <p>halved currency, a concept noun recent rise, BTC, BCH, BSV, ETC is hot “money<br>in half.” It should be noted that the currency is not halved things a newborn.</p>
<p>For a certain understanding of the encryption currency friend, “halving the<br>money” is very easy to understand, is that the currency has halved mining<br>incentive mechanism design, They can be called halved currency.</p>
<p>further explanation, we must first understand what is mining reward half. Here<br>to Bitcoin for example, we know the total circulation of Bitcoins is 21<br>million, and so many Bitcoin is not issued all at once, but little by little<br>produce mining until all 21 million bitcoins being dug. Nakamoto Bitcoin<br>mining in the design, on the one hand to mobilize the enthusiasm of the early<br>miners, on the other hand to make Bitcoin become increasingly valuable<br>(currency price higher and higher), based on the principle of supply and<br>demand relationship between the design market every four years the mining<br>reward halving the rules. Bitcoin born in just the first four years, miners<br>dug after the success blocks available 50-bit coin reward; after the first<br>halved in 2012, successfully dug block reward, becomes 25; 2016 after the 2nd<br>half, reward becomes 12.5 Bitcoin. 2020 is the third year of halving Bitcoin,<br>after the May (estimated time) in half this year, mining reward will become<br>6.25.</p>
<p>in the past 11 years, half due to a bit after each increment on the market<br>reduction credits bit credits become more scarce, thus boosting its prices. In<br>the past two encryption money market bull market, it has tied up with the<br>association halved Bitcoin. So after halving the price rise caused by<br>currency, also known as “halving the market.”</p>
<p>May 2020 (estimated), the third time in half a year mining reward Bitcoin,<br>people’s expectations that this will bring new Bitcoin round of the bull<br>market. Because it is directly related to the miners, investors and other<br>participants in pocket money, as much attention.</p>
<p>Further, after the birth of numerous credits bit encryption imitate it<br>currency, credits and bifurcated by a bit from the bifurcated credits, many of<br>them also used “halved” design, but not necessarily four years halved once,<br>not necessarily reduce by half the reward (such as ETC rate cut this year only<br>20%).</p>
<p>By 2020, many encryption currency Bitcoin follow, have chosen to be halved<br>this year, removing the currently most influential Bitcoin, concern high BCH,<br>BSV, eTC and other currencies, as well as dozens of smaller coins have chosen<br>to be halved by 2020. Therefore, in 2020, also known as the halving.</p>
<p>It is expected that this year is likely to usher in a new wave of the bull<br>market, current market conditions also support this expectation. But this is<br>not absolute, because the encryption in the currency market after ten years of<br>development, become more complex, more and more factors that affect the value<br>of the currency, how much influence halve the effect of actually left, is not<br>known.</p>
