      <a class="article-title" href="/2020/02/11/574628/">Golden Encyclopedia | What is a token destruction? Why should we destroy?</a>
    </h1>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>According to the latest bulletin OKEx, OKB in the future development plans<br>announced, OKEx destroyed OKB 700 million unissued. 2018, when the total<br>announced the release OKB 1.0 billion, an initial circulation of 300 million,<br>the announced 700 million OKB destroyed unreleased, on behalf of OKB<br>officially entered the era of absolute deflation, will also become the world’s<br>first full circulation the platform currency. In addition, the announcement<br>said, OKEx team will no longer be reserved OKB, OKB repurchase will be<br>completely destroyed from the secondary market repurchase. Meanwhile, OKEx<br>privately promised never to additional OKB. OKB migrate to smart Contract Code<br>later OKChain main network will remove the issuance.</p>
<p><strong>What is destroyed? How to destroy? Why should we destroy? After the<br>destruction of coins gone it?</strong></p>
<p>The so-called destruction is part of the currency in circulation permanently<br>removed from the market. Lock in on a coin has basically been completed<br>release (Lock release will increase the throughput) currency, the destruction<br>of means of direct digital circulation permanently reduced, that is a direct<br>result of deflation, price is obviously there for the money the more obvious<br>role in promoting.</p>
<p>There are two common ways to destroy the currency, into the black hole<br>address, or directly using a smart contract destroyed.</p>
<p>The so-called black hole, is to go to be swallowed, not even think about it,<br>the foreign call Eater Address, the very image. Black hole address is a<br>special address, so far no one has mastered their private key, the future is<br>almost impossible. Common example: a black hole address Bitcoin<br>1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE, as well as the Ethernet address black hole<br>Square 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000. Both addresses a lot of<br>wealth, but due to the nature of the currency encryption, brute of a private<br>address, but also the need from more than 37 times the power of 10-bit private<br>key focus money than the number of sand on Earth, one by one to try, just be<br>prohibitively difficult. So address into a black hole of money, equivalent to<br>almost destroyed, from the market in circulation permanently removed.  </p>
<p>This time, the destruction of the black hole OKB address:<br>0xff1ee8604f9ec9c3bb292633bb939321ae861b30.</p>
<p>So, why should the tokens to destroy it? The main reasons are the following:</p>
<p>1, the project uses a PoB consensus mechanism. PoB (Proof of Burn), burn proof<br>mechanism, namely to prove that the user inputs to the network by encrypting<br>the destruction of the currency, which was “mining” and the right to verify<br>the transaction. Burn (destroy) the more we have the greater the (virtual)<br>operator force.</p>
<p>2, reduce circulation, thereby increasing the value of the Token. The case of<br>supply and demand affect the price, other things being equal, to reduce the<br>supply, prices will rise. Some items will be destroyed by means of tokens,<br>reducing liquidity in the market, thus adding value to the token, such as<br>fire, coins, currency security, OKEx are regularly destroyed part of the<br>platform currency.</p>
<p>In addition, there are other reasons might be destroyed tokens, such as user<br>error or intentional tokens into the black hole address, or some intelligent<br>project contract default Gas burning address and so on.</p>

    </h1>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>In early 2020, the new coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan and at a very<br>fast speed spread quickly swept the country. State, local governments and<br>businesses have responded, to do its utmost to fight the epidemic. Pursue a<br>“block chain +” and better able to improve the social life of the project,<br>have begun to use technology, began to play a role in various fields.</p>
<p>ant ants gold dress block chain block chain launched platform, is committed to<br>contributing to the block chain in real industry landing. Related technology<br>has been put into court in Hangzhou Internet, ants gold dress public platform,<br>such as Lynx to use, covering charity, the source, the contract as evidence,<br>commodity block chain such as warehouse receipts.</p>
<p>In the fight against the epidemic, the ants block chain also had an<br>outstanding performance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>as evidence on the chain</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>around the relief supplies have rushed to the front line to fight the<br>epidemic, but the face of the huge number of materials and far far enough<br>manpower statistics, in the process can not do transparency of information,<br>even if the synchronization, flexible mobilization frequent problems. This not<br>only seriously affect the efficiency of the fight against the epidemic, but<br>also to the public have some doubts about charity process.</p>
<p>At present, Alipay has been on-line information service platform for epidemic<br>prevention materials, with the travel search queries to see. It is reported<br>that Zhejiang Medical Materials Group has launched the first bills of material<br>needs, including medical masks, protective clothing, hats, and other work.<br>Epidemic prevention materials information service platform using the ant block<br>chain technology, led by the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Committee Wei,<br>by letter to the Office, the demand for materials, supplies, transportation<br>and other aspects of the information will be reviewed and the chain as<br>evidence.</p>
<p>With related technology to ensure the platform, relief supplies can be done at<br>any time to be investigated, traceable, and can not be tampered with. Various<br>places for the deployment of materials, use can also be synchronized to the<br>chain, easy to use and flexible deployment of materials.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alipay also provide a permanent force to the free block chain<br>operator epidemic related applet developers, special financial support.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>processing insurance claims</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>during the outbreak, another treasure has been used to block chain management-<br>related coronavirus claim.</p>
<p>another treasure is a serious illness in 2018 Huzhugongji service Alipay App<br>on line members to encounter major diseases (in the range of 100 kinds) will<br>be eligible for 300,000 or 10 thousand dollars in guarantees gold, cost shared<br>by all members. Currently, mutual treasure novel coronavirus has been added to<br>the eligible diseases, a one-time maximum payment amount is about 100,000<br>yuan.</p>
<p>This is a fall application block chain in the insurance industry. Insurance,<br>welfare, and other areas crowdfunding has been the hardest hit by a crisis of<br>confidence, endless liar and a variety of tricks, so that the public again and<br>again sank. When the function has just launched another treasure, some people<br>questioned: potentially fraudulent situation will not occur?</p>
<p>block chain is referred to as a trusted machine, formal disclosure,<br>transparency, and other technical characteristics can not be altered, and<br>ensure that there will potentially fraudulent situation Repudiation occurs.<br>Always looking for the insurance company for reimbursement of hospitalization<br>expenses, you must first pay a lot of the list, then the insurance companies<br>to enter the complex review stage, lengthy process complicated not say, but<br>also a great human and material resources consumed.</p>
<p>No problem as long as the information submitted, the insurance company will<br>generally be reimbursed in accordance with the contract, of course, can not<br>rule out that some insurance companies will be a variety of reasons for<br>insurance coverage, causing mental burden on patients and their families.</p>
<p>The block chain is to simply say that hospitals, insurance agencies, patients<br>and their families are placed in a circle, out of the hospital according to<br>the actual situation of patients found to comply with the requirements of the<br>insurance agencies, insurance funds in the smart contract paid automatically,<br>complete reimbursement. In this process, reducing the transparency of<br>information through the tedious process, but also to enforce the contract by<br>intelligence, to ensure that the rights of patients.</p>
<p>treasure each other on the insurance may not be a common sense, but the block<br>chain in which the role or less.</p>
