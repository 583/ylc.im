        <p>golden Finance February 12 hearing on monetary encryption friendly attitude of<br>Chinese American presidential candidate Yang Anze (Andrew Yang), has announced<br>the withdrawal in 2020 elections. Yang Anze is a Taiwan-born American<br>entrepreneur, the American business (Venture for America), founder of the<br>organization, he was a Democratic primary candidate for the US presidential<br>election.</p>
<p><img src="/2020/02/13/575489/0.png" alt="RO8SeLAQRCcYyTDC4GtyH2J7iT9mx54EXgj7eaRk.jpeg"> According to Gold<br>Finance previously reported, Yang Anze is US presidential candidates, one of<br>the few strong supporter of encryption currency, he has many times in public,<br>even behind encryption currency, its campaign has also announced its<br>acceptance of BTC, ETH and any other standards-based ERC20 currency donations.</p>
<p>On the currency to be encrypted attitude, Yang Anze said in an interview with<br>Bloomberg News editor Joe • Weisenthal (Joe Weisenthal) interview that the<br>United States flawed encryption regulations, and many state regulations is not<br>conducive to innovation. About Joe • Weisenthal cited problems in the industry<br>on the “regulatory intends to limit capital inflows bit encryption coins and<br>other money market”, Yang Anze given the neutral answer, as long as he tried<br>to “Bitcoin” who know that no matter how strict supervision, and ultimately<br>can not impede, or prevent Bitcoin.</p>
<p>On the regulatory views on encryption currency, Yang Anze had recommended that<br>the regulations be updated to “unified national regulatory framework,” This<br>will not only increase the degree of innovation, but also improve regulatory<br>clarity, in his proposal He wrote: “investment currency encryption and digital<br>assets far beyond the uS regulatory framework, we should allow investors, both<br>individuals and businesses understand regulatory toward supporting the<br>development of innovative in dealing with the issue of the blocks. chain has<br>enormous potential. “</p>
<p>in addition, Yang Anze not only very supportive of encryption widely quoted in<br>the currency of the United States, he is also very respected block chain<br>technology. He was questioned on Twitter to respond to others, he said:.<br>“Block chain has enormous potential to make many things more transparent and<br>efficient” and an example application examples will be presented block chain<br>technology for the US presidential vote, he said: “Today, using chain blocks<br>on our phone anti-vote fraud, it is technically feasible to 100% of this<br>practice will completely change the existing voting system, and bring real<br>democracy, because all of the United States. people will participate in the<br>vote, no one can use smart phones the old system, it is not difficult to<br>achieve. “</p>
<p>perhaps Yang Anze US presidential race is not the most popular candidate, but<br>his exit, for encryption Currency industry is still a loss.</p>

        <p>is a derivative continuity contract. From the perspective of the transaction,<br>it is similar to the traditional futures contracts, but there are some<br>differences. First, it is no expiration date or settlement, and sustainable<br>swaps similar to a margin spot market, so it is close to the trading price of<br>the underlying reference index price, unlike futures contracts, due to the<br>difference of the base, spread trading futures contracts There may be<br>significant differences. Second, the main mechanism for anchoring spot price<br>is the cost of funds.</p>
<p><strong>sustainable current contract main form is a rolling contract (Rolling Spot<br>Futures</strong> <strong>).</strong> is a rolling contract and the date of settlement of futures<br>contracts automatically renewed each day settlement gains and losses, traders<br>hold positions of contract will be automatically renewed at the end of the<br>trading day. In addition, there will be cash flow of assets to be exchanged,<br>the cost of funds to pay long short, short to compensate for the cost of<br>capital. Scroll contract is actually equivalent combination of automatic<br>renewal of contracts and the spot date of the currency swap, this product<br>originated in 1993, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (ChicagoMercantile<br>Exchange, CME) in order to avoid the huge cost of the underlying spot foreign<br>exchange settlement and the development of rolling contract, followed by the<br>emergence of gold rolling futures contracts and other varieties, mainly for<br>online retail market, serving small investors do not demand physical delivery.<br>Such contract relatively simple operation, without regard for positions<br>delivery and other steps required for professional investors is relatively<br>low, and the spot may be provided close to experience. Market mechanisms</p>
<p><strong>sustainable contract</strong></p>
<p>When trading futures contracts, traders need to understand the mechanisms of<br>several futures markets. A key part of traders should be noted that:  </p>

<p>initial and maintenance margin: these critical margin levels determines how<br>much leverage can be used, and at what price would trigger a margin call.</p>
<p>capital costs: every eight hours regularly pay between buyer and seller. If<br>the rate is positive, the long positions and short positions will pay to<br>obtain funds rate, if the rate is negative, and vice versa. Please note that<br>you only hold positions in the capital timestamp, you only need to pay or<br>receive funding costs.</p>
<p>funds timestamp: 00: 00 (UTC + 8), 08: 00 (UTC + 8) and 16:00 (UTC + 8).<br>Traders can be found in the current funds rate contracts trading in the upper<br>right corner of the page. Similarly, you can also be found in this one rates<br>from the “Contract Details” in. Historical rates can be found in the funds<br>rate history.</p>
<p>perpetual contract for ordinary investors, in line with the concept of<br>decentralization of the block chain assets, for the status quo through the<br>card market, can prevent the accumulation of wear-sharing positions affect<br>investor expectations, increased market activity, facilitate arbitrage and<br>hedging, in favor of the introduction of institutional investors, and improve<br>market pricing mechanism. When</p>
<p>There is no limit perpetual contract term, sustainable arbitrage strategies to<br>use to perform the contract, contract delivery and do not worry about the<br>spread has not generated additional costs for positions expected to change<br>direction, can increase market pricing effectiveness. Hedging contracts to use<br>sustainable time can more easily select a hedging avoid wearing the cartridge<br>can not be assessed cumulatively hedging, or contract time is too short for<br>positions repeatedly.</p>
