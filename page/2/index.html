        <p>golden Finance February 12 hearing on monetary encryption friendly attitude of<br>Chinese American presidential candidate Yang Anze (Andrew Yang), has announced<br>the withdrawal in 2020 elections. Yang Anze is a Taiwan-born American<br>entrepreneur, the American business (Venture for America), founder of the<br>organization, he was a Democratic primary candidate for the US presidential<br>election.</p>
<p><img src="/2020/02/13/575489/0.png" alt="RO8SeLAQRCcYyTDC4GtyH2J7iT9mx54EXgj7eaRk.jpeg"> According to Gold<br>Finance previously reported, Yang Anze is US presidential candidates, one of<br>the few strong supporter of encryption currency, he has many times in public,<br>even behind encryption currency, its campaign has also announced its<br>acceptance of BTC, ETH and any other standards-based ERC20 currency donations.</p>
<p>On the currency to be encrypted attitude, Yang Anze said in an interview with<br>Bloomberg News editor Joe • Weisenthal (Joe Weisenthal) interview that the<br>United States flawed encryption regulations, and many state regulations is not<br>conducive to innovation. About Joe • Weisenthal cited problems in the industry<br>on the “regulatory intends to limit capital inflows bit encryption coins and<br>other money market”, Yang Anze given the neutral answer, as long as he tried<br>to “Bitcoin” who know that no matter how strict supervision, and ultimately<br>can not impede, or prevent Bitcoin.</p>
<p>On the regulatory views on encryption currency, Yang Anze had recommended that<br>the regulations be updated to “unified national regulatory framework,” This<br>will not only increase the degree of innovation, but also improve regulatory<br>clarity, in his proposal He wrote: “investment currency encryption and digital<br>assets far beyond the uS regulatory framework, we should allow investors, both<br>individuals and businesses understand regulatory toward supporting the<br>development of innovative in dealing with the issue of the blocks. chain has<br>enormous potential. “</p>
<p>in addition, Yang Anze not only very supportive of encryption widely quoted in<br>the currency of the United States, he is also very respected block chain<br>technology. He was questioned on Twitter to respond to others, he said:.<br>“Block chain has enormous potential to make many things more transparent and<br>efficient” and an example application examples will be presented block chain<br>technology for the US presidential vote, he said: “Today, using chain blocks<br>on our phone anti-vote fraud, it is technically feasible to 100% of this<br>practice will completely change the existing voting system, and bring real<br>democracy, because all of the United States. people will participate in the<br>vote, no one can use smart phones the old system, it is not difficult to<br>achieve. “</p>
<p>perhaps Yang Anze US presidential race is not the most popular candidate, but<br>his exit, for encryption Currency industry is still a loss.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Spring Festival this year, people across the country are plagued by heart<br>disease. The new coronavirus epidemic raging, Hubei Province affected by the<br>degree of particularly serious. Epidemic not only threatens the health and<br>safety of people, but also cause trauma to the stable economic development,<br>industrial chain block is also not immune.</p>
<p>Under the epidemic, What is the status block chain enterprises to survive?<br>Finance this gold trading platform to connect segments of the industry,<br>mining, security companies, investment institutions such as the head of a<br>number of companies, a list of industry status quo, and seek common<br>development industry in the future.</p>
<p>This article is golden Finance exclusive interview with <strong>Gate.io</strong> Record.</p>
<p><strong>Gold Finance:</strong> What do you think the block chain technology can do for the<br>fight against the epidemic? Specific development space will open up in what<br>areas?</p>
<p><strong>Gate.io wine children:</strong> block chain technology can be very good to enhance<br>the transparency of charitable contributions. Traditional donors, because of<br>the lack of clear oversight and clear information tracking system, in this<br>outbreak, exposed the serious crisis of confidence, which is contrary to the<br>original intention, very sad thing. The tamper-proof block chain and<br>characteristic information can be found just good solution to these problems.<br>From every sum of money to donate supplies, should have its own identity block<br>chain, from beginning to end, we can be clear and easy to see, rather than as<br>they are now blind to donate, it is more urged by public opinion, even<br>ordinary people can also be viewed on the chain to each hospital accepted and<br>the number of materials consumed, so as to avoid wasting donations, a real<br>open, fair, to be investigated.</p>
<p><strong>Gold Finance:</strong> in the current outbreak, your business is facing what<br>problem? Whether to start, whether normal operations, whether layoffs? (Cost,<br>cash flow problems, work problems) has taken measures to deal with?</p>
<p><strong>Gate.io wine children:</strong> we okay · The outbreak does not lead to the<br>enterprise started to work from home and other issues, but for us, not too<br>great . Because Gate.io has been using the globally distributed office<br>methods, the epidemic of overseas employees are not affected. During the<br>previous non-epidemic, many of our employees are also remote collaboration,<br>online office forms, so communication in the team, with respect, management<br>systems are relatively satisfactory. During the epidemic, the epidemic zone<br>everyone needs to cooperate with the national policy, actively carry out<br>protection work at home, but also have more time to focus on the market,<br>coupled with the recent market volatility is relatively large, so the user<br>transactions are increasing, Gate.io cash flow has been normal, GateChain team<br>is in constant recruitment of technical personnel, technical strength<br>enhancement.</p>
<p><strong>Gold Finance:</strong> in your observation, the block chain industry what changes<br>will have in the meantime? For many companies block chain security through the<br>epidemic, what advice do you have?  </p>
<p><strong>Gate.io wine children:</strong> to tell the truth, I really feel that this epidemic<br>has little effect on the block chain industry. After all, most employees are<br>not many, most of them technical staff. You can work from home. To mention a<br>few small suggestions it ·</p>
<p>1: go to the center of a large office is necessary. Initially block chain is<br>not solved trust it.</p>
<p>2: Point Club less soft mode, multi-point savings, happiness is only<br>temporary, no savings, would have been flustered ah, after all, many employees<br>still need money to buy daily necessities. You can not eat cake.</p>
<p>3: You do not know what tomorrow and the unexpected arrival of the first, good<br>property and backup important data.</p>
