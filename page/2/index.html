        <p>is a derivative continuity contract. From the perspective of the transaction,<br>it is similar to the traditional futures contracts, but there are some<br>differences. First, it is no expiration date or settlement, and sustainable<br>swaps similar to a margin spot market, so it is close to the trading price of<br>the underlying reference index price, unlike futures contracts, due to the<br>difference of the base, spread trading futures contracts There may be<br>significant differences. Second, the main mechanism for anchoring spot price<br>is the cost of funds.</p>
<p><strong>sustainable current contract main form is a rolling contract (Rolling Spot<br>Futures</strong> <strong>).</strong> is a rolling contract and the date of settlement of futures<br>contracts automatically renewed each day settlement gains and losses, traders<br>hold positions of contract will be automatically renewed at the end of the<br>trading day. In addition, there will be cash flow of assets to be exchanged,<br>the cost of funds to pay long short, short to compensate for the cost of<br>capital. Scroll contract is actually equivalent combination of automatic<br>renewal of contracts and the spot date of the currency swap, this product<br>originated in 1993, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (ChicagoMercantile<br>Exchange, CME) in order to avoid the huge cost of the underlying spot foreign<br>exchange settlement and the development of rolling contract, followed by the<br>emergence of gold rolling futures contracts and other varieties, mainly for<br>online retail market, serving small investors do not demand physical delivery.<br>Such contract relatively simple operation, without regard for positions<br>delivery and other steps required for professional investors is relatively<br>low, and the spot may be provided close to experience. Market mechanisms</p>
<p><strong>sustainable contract</strong></p>
<p>When trading futures contracts, traders need to understand the mechanisms of<br>several futures markets. A key part of traders should be noted that:  </p>
<p>fair price: sustainable use of swaps reasonable and fair price method.<br>Determine a fair price unrealized gains and losses and strong flat price.  </p>
<p>initial and maintenance margin: these critical margin levels determines how<br>much leverage can be used, and at what price would trigger a margin call.</p>
<p>capital costs: every eight hours regularly pay between buyer and seller. If<br>the rate is positive, the long positions and short positions will pay to<br>obtain funds rate, if the rate is negative, and vice versa. Please note that<br>you only hold positions in the capital timestamp, you only need to pay or<br>receive funding costs.</p>
<p>funds timestamp: 00: 00 (UTC + 8), 08: 00 (UTC + 8) and 16:00 (UTC + 8).<br>Traders can be found in the current funds rate contracts trading in the upper<br>right corner of the page. Similarly, you can also be found in this one rates<br>from the “Contract Details” in. Historical rates can be found in the funds<br>rate history.</p>
<p>perpetual contract for ordinary investors, in line with the concept of<br>decentralization of the block chain assets, for the status quo through the<br>card market, can prevent the accumulation of wear-sharing positions affect<br>investor expectations, increased market activity, facilitate arbitrage and<br>hedging, in favor of the introduction of institutional investors, and improve<br>market pricing mechanism. When</p>
<p>There is no limit perpetual contract term, sustainable arbitrage strategies to<br>use to perform the contract, contract delivery and do not worry about the<br>spread has not generated additional costs for positions expected to change<br>direction, can increase market pricing effectiveness. Hedging contracts to use<br>sustainable time can more easily select a hedging avoid wearing the cartridge<br>can not be assessed cumulatively hedging, or contract time is too short for<br>positions repeatedly.</p>
<p>number of mainstream online trading platform has been or is preparing for<br>perpetual contract products. December 19, 2018, the sustainable contract line<br>OKEx product currently supports BTC, ETH, EOS, LTC, XRP, BCH and TRX nine<br>varieties, this flagship product exchange agreement conforms to the trend of<br>sustainable contracts . The same month on the 24th, Gate.io on the line BTC<br>perpetual contract a firm offer, then gradually on the line ETH and other<br>varieties. After the December 2018 contract on the line product, Lan<br>Jianzhong, vice president Huobi Group, said in the future in order to meet<br>user demand will contract to launch sustainable products.</p>

        <p>Spring Festival this year, people across the country are plagued by heart<br>disease. The new coronavirus epidemic raging, Hubei Province affected by the<br>degree of particularly serious. Epidemic not only threatens the health and<br>safety of people, but also cause trauma to the stable economic development,<br>industrial chain block is also not immune.</p>
<p>Under the epidemic, What is the status block chain enterprises to survive?<br>Finance this gold trading platform to connect segments of the industry,<br>mining, security companies, investment institutions such as the head of a<br>number of companies, a list of industry status quo, and seek common<br>development industry in the future.</p>
<p>This article is golden Finance exclusive interview with <strong>Gate.io</strong> Record.</p>
<p><strong>Gold Finance:</strong> What do you think the block chain technology can do for the<br>fight against the epidemic? Specific development space will open up in what<br>areas?</p>
<p><strong>Gate.io wine children:</strong> block chain technology can be very good to enhance<br>the transparency of charitable contributions. Traditional donors, because of<br>the lack of clear oversight and clear information tracking system, in this<br>outbreak, exposed the serious crisis of confidence, which is contrary to the<br>original intention, very sad thing. The tamper-proof block chain and<br>characteristic information can be found just good solution to these problems.<br>From every sum of money to donate supplies, should have its own identity block<br>chain, from beginning to end, we can be clear and easy to see, rather than as<br>they are now blind to donate, it is more urged by public opinion, even<br>ordinary people can also be viewed on the chain to each hospital accepted and<br>the number of materials consumed, so as to avoid wasting donations, a real<br>open, fair, to be investigated.</p>
<p><strong>Gold Finance:</strong> in the current outbreak, your business is facing what<br>problem? Whether to start, whether normal operations, whether layoffs? (Cost,<br>cash flow problems, work problems) has taken measures to deal with?</p>
<p><strong>Gate.io wine children:</strong> we okay · The outbreak does not lead to the<br>enterprise started to work from home and other issues, but for us, not too<br>great . Because Gate.io has been using the globally distributed office<br>methods, the epidemic of overseas employees are not affected. During the<br>previous non-epidemic, many of our employees are also remote collaboration,<br>online office forms, so communication in the team, with respect, management<br>systems are relatively satisfactory. During the epidemic, the epidemic zone<br>everyone needs to cooperate with the national policy, actively carry out<br>protection work at home, but also have more time to focus on the market,<br>coupled with the recent market volatility is relatively large, so the user<br>transactions are increasing, Gate.io cash flow has been normal, GateChain team<br>is in constant recruitment of technical personnel, technical strength<br>enhancement.</p>
<p><strong>Gold Finance:</strong> in your observation, the block chain industry what changes<br>will have in the meantime? For many companies block chain security through the<br>epidemic, what advice do you have?  </p>
<p><strong>Gate.io wine children:</strong> to tell the truth, I really feel that this epidemic<br>has little effect on the block chain industry. After all, most employees are<br>not many, most of them technical staff. You can work from home. To mention a<br>few small suggestions it ·</p>
<p>1: go to the center of a large office is necessary. Initially block chain is<br>not solved trust it.</p>
<p>2: Point Club less soft mode, multi-point savings, happiness is only<br>temporary, no savings, would have been flustered ah, after all, many employees<br>still need money to buy daily necessities. You can not eat cake.</p>
<p>3: You do not know what tomorrow and the unexpected arrival of the first, good<br>property and backup important data.</p>
<p>4: The object is to find to find the object, the children have children, or<br>you see hold home for 20 days, and more boring.</p>
<p><strong>Gold Finance:</strong> Outlook 2020, you have expectations of how business and<br>block chain industry you are in?</p>
<p><strong>Gate.io wine children:</strong> at the beginning of 2020 is not very good, but does<br>not mean the end of good. In any case, the sense of, take every step ahead.<br>Come together duck</p>
<p><strong>Gold Finance:!</strong> below the epidemic, parties rush to the rescue Wuhan, your<br>business is mainly made of what action?  </p>
<p><strong>Gate.io wine children:</strong> was truly a bitter tears, find many twists and<br>turns. As a Pisces, especially when you encounter some can not understand,<br>even when people and things repeatedly stood up, tears could even not stop the<br>flow. Although the entire process somewhat difficult, but after everyone’s<br>efforts, the final result was very good.</p>
<p>So far, Gate.io official has donated masks only 2.5W (distributed to four<br>hospitals), disinfectant 1.7 tons (+ 8 hospitals assigned to a village),<br>medical gloves 6w only ( assigned to the six hospitals), goggles 200 (assigned<br>to three hospitals), 240 sets of protective clothing (assigned to three<br>hospitals) and designed for users send only 2w medical masks, masks user is<br>expected tomorrow, the day after being issued.</p>

        <p>golden Finance February 12 hearing on monetary encryption friendly attitude of<br>Chinese American presidential candidate Yang Anze (Andrew Yang), has announced<br>the withdrawal in 2020 elections. Yang Anze is a Taiwan-born American<br>entrepreneur, the American business (Venture for America), founder of the<br>organization, he was a Democratic primary candidate for the US presidential<br>election.</p>
<p><img src="/2020/02/13/575489/0.png" alt="RO8SeLAQRCcYyTDC4GtyH2J7iT9mx54EXgj7eaRk.jpeg"> According to Gold<br>Finance previously reported, Yang Anze is US presidential candidates, one of<br>the few strong supporter of encryption currency, he has many times in public,<br>even behind encryption currency, its campaign has also announced its<br>acceptance of BTC, ETH and any other standards-based ERC20 currency donations.</p>
<p>On the currency to be encrypted attitude, Yang Anze said in an interview with<br>Bloomberg News editor Joe • Weisenthal (Joe Weisenthal) interview that the<br>United States flawed encryption regulations, and many state regulations is not<br>conducive to innovation. About Joe • Weisenthal cited problems in the industry<br>on the “regulatory intends to limit capital inflows bit encryption coins and<br>other money market”, Yang Anze given the neutral answer, as long as he tried<br>to “Bitcoin” who know that no matter how strict supervision, and ultimately<br>can not impede, or prevent Bitcoin.</p>
<p>On the regulatory views on encryption currency, Yang Anze had recommended that<br>the regulations be updated to “unified national regulatory framework,” This<br>will not only increase the degree of innovation, but also improve regulatory<br>clarity, in his proposal He wrote: “investment currency encryption and digital<br>assets far beyond the uS regulatory framework, we should allow investors, both<br>individuals and businesses understand regulatory toward supporting the<br>development of innovative in dealing with the issue of the blocks. chain has<br>enormous potential. “</p>
<p>in addition, Yang Anze not only very supportive of encryption widely quoted in<br>the currency of the United States, he is also very respected block chain<br>technology. He was questioned on Twitter to respond to others, he said:.<br>“Block chain has enormous potential to make many things more transparent and<br>efficient” and an example application examples will be presented block chain<br>technology for the US presidential vote, he said: “Today, using chain blocks<br>on our phone anti-vote fraud, it is technically feasible to 100% of this<br>practice will completely change the existing voting system, and bring real<br>democracy, because all of the United States. people will participate in the<br>vote, no one can use smart phones the old system, it is not difficult to<br>achieve. “</p>
<p>perhaps Yang Anze US presidential race is not the most popular candidate, but<br>his exit, for encryption Currency industry is still a loss.</p>
