        <p>the second half of 2019, fire coins launched “his VIP that is my VIP” and<br>“All-Star VIP” event a hit from the spot, contract and then to OTC, direct<br>industry “grab” high net worth customers. For a time the major exchanges have<br>followed suit, lowering tariff barriers and VIP. To HT, represented by<br>platform currency is also surging.</p>
<p>February 12 this year, the fire station again announced the global currency<br>rating upgraded user rules and VIP interests. Transactions and positions you<br>can have firepower value, everyone can become a VIP. Market sentiment was<br>immediately ignited, fire coin VIP user interests and values ​​behind HT also<br>a hot topic.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the fire coins at the user level and the rules of<br>equity VIP upgrade for the first time proposed a “fire value” concept. User<br>level will be determined by the value firepower, firepower higher value, the<br>higher the level, the more will enjoy VIP equity. Under the new rules hold HT<br>VIP users will receive double the value of the acceleration firepower become<br>VIP.</p>
<p>Some market participants believe that money to upgrade fire VIP equity, will<br>attract a large number of users for the sprint VIP waist and equity holdings<br>HT, it is expected to have more than 200 potential VIP users HT and potential<br>buying 8 million, equivalent to 2019 Q4 quarter to repurchase the entire<br>amount of HT.</p>
<p>So this “fire value” to be about? What are the rules different VIP levels<br>firepower value corresponds? What are the implications of HT and there will<br>be?</p>
<p><strong>transactions and positions you can have firepower value, become a VIP is not<br>so difficult to imagine</strong></p>
<p>the so-called” fire value “is the credit history of fire users in currency<br>trading near three-month natural or held digital assets can be assets, digital<br>asset positions adopted by transaction number. In addition, users will receive<br>double the firepower to hold HT value of the acceleration to be VIP.</p>
<p>in digital asset transactions, each additional user 2,000 USD equivalent<br>volume, the value obtained a fire; digital asset in position, the user<br>positions the daily USDT, HUSD, HT, BTC, ETH, LTC, EOS, XRP, BCH, TRX, BSV,<br>eTC and other digital assets available “firepower value”, each holding 10,000<br>USDT daily receive up to 1 “firepower value.”</p>
<p>HT may be held in acceleration value is obtained firepower, 11 November 2019 -<br>the period February 11, 2020 (GMT + 8), each user holds 62,501 “firepower<br>value” HT available, from 2020, February 12 (GTM + 8) on, each user is<br>adjusted to hold the value of 5000 USDT of HT, you can get a “firepower<br>value.” In other words, hold HT enjoy double the firepower value, accelerate<br>user to become VIP.</p>
<p><strong>The higher the value of the fire VIP interest, HT accelerator or a VIP</strong></p>
<p>Further Huobi user level determined by the value of the fire, fire higher<br>value, the higher the level, the user will be able to enjoy more VIP rights,<br>the corresponding relationship in the following table:</p>
<p><img src="/2020/02/14/576707/0.png" alt="5pI9Aj5FYh7P8Bo74GBLlKPG4dUCGQdslTRjmV90.png"></p>
<p><strong>updated on grade and is valid</strong> 1 month, the user level is updated based on<br>the current value of firepower, valid until the last day of each month. If the<br>value of the user firepower meet the criteria in any month, day, then go to<br>the next level in real time, the period of validity of the rating upgrade and<br>continue until the last day of next month.</p>
<p><strong>user will face the same level of degradation limit.</strong> when monthly update is<br>rated No. 1, if the user does not meet the minimum requirements of the<br>original level, will face a downgrade, but the downgrade is limited to at most<br>monthly drop level.</p>
<p>Finally, we can see by the rules, holding fire HT users will receive double<br>the value of the acceleration to be VIP. This is undoubtedly a great boon for<br>enabling HT. Especially for users near the VIP level, the assets into the HT<br>that is faster to become VIP, so HT will inevitably lead to huge buying in the<br>user’s waist drive.</p>
<p>currently has positive reaction in the disk, HT prices in the secondary market<br>is strong all the way. Before the existing market participants believe, it is<br>expected to have more than 200 potential VIP users and 8 million potential<br>buying HT, equivalent to 2019 Q4 quarter to repurchase the entire amount of<br>HT. In 2020 HT This is also another major good news, followed by HT price or<br>bring a new surprise to the market.</p>
