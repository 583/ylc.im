        <p>With the beginning of the year after Bitcoin rapid rise, the market has for<br>the formation of a new round of Dallas City gradually reached a consensus,<br>particularly in recent Bitcoin back on the 10,000 mark integer;: &lt; “left text-<br>align” p style =&gt; , FOMO sentiment in the market is becoming increasingly<br>apparent, how to grasp this continued rise in prices, it has become the focus<br>of attention of all market participants.</p>
<p>This article will outstripped all the news or the so-called fundamental<br>factors under the premise, I share a simple trading ideas, and this seems<br>simple logic, but just apply to the current Bitcoin market, as to whether the<br>transaction in accordance with the plan, you readers can decisions on their<br>own.</p>
<p>First of all clear that this trading technique does not provide the reader<br>with a very “simple and crude,” the copy trading scheme, the reader needs to<br>be able to determine their own to some extent, in the case of market trend, to<br>find out how effective trading admission time, and how to effectively carry<br>out asset allocation. So, if you want to get down to the specific point single<br>admission, they may let you down.</p>
<p>in the rising trend in market confirmation process, can be very effective<br>average reference “reference.” 50 period moving average and four hours, four<br>hours 200 period moving average and 50 day moving average and 200-day moving<br>average is four very effective technical indicators. Specific use is not<br>complicated, in fact, in order to support this dynamic four line as a<br>reference, in the rising trend in market prices technical adjustments to the<br>configuration ratio of account funds:</p>
<p>4 hour 50 period moving average: 10%</p>
<p>4 hours 200 cycle average: 20%</p>
<p>50-day moving average: 30%</p>
<p>200-day moving average: 40%</p>
<p>4-hour</p>
<p>daily</p>
<p>In simple terms, when the market is hit back to step long entry position with<br>10% of the total capital of 400 hours and 50 period EMA, and step back to hit<br>a configuration of 20% of funds 4 hours 200 period moving average, and so on.</p>
<p>arranged in accordance with the position at the time this method is not<br>recommended at a fixed price or a simple fixed proportion to stop protection,<br>is also recommended to critical moving average manifestations composition as a<br>reference standard. Used as a reference standard also above four moving<br>average, moving average and short period once the downward moving average form<br>Sicha piercing long period, the stop signal is issued, the market will soon<br>rise high probability reversal, it is necessary in this case timely adjustment<br>of the direction of trading options rather than a single continuous cover<br>short positions at prices continue to decline Shihai.</p>
<p>is supported such a simple average system provided / further by resistance<br>point before a high / low before, the key trend line / channel complex like<br>support way to verify, and they are many technical analysis tools Once the key<br>point there is the conclusion overlapping, so sure of trading ideas will be<br>increased dramatically.</p>
<p>In the approaching step back when the market position of the key support<br>short-term trend line key or the like moving average, there is determined a<br>more convenient way to confirm transactions over into field chance has come,<br>that is, three-line / five-wire confirmation method, which is a simplified<br>version of the Bill Williams fractal structure.</p>
<p>In simple terms, the market is concerned effectively reach the front and rear<br>take-up performance of key technical support / resistance reference point<br>three consecutive root node or not the K line. With an upward trend in the<br>callback, for example, need to focus on disk performance when the stock market<br>hit a key moving average back foot / trend line support.</p>
<p>K line when the minimum point where should the effective reach / approaching<br>key support, and an open line K-line before and after each of the T / R line<br>position and Movies line high / low position above the low point of all four<br>dimensions when K line where the reference position, which can be completed in<br>a simple small inflection / determination stabilized, were based on the ratio<br>of the positions mentioned hereinbefore in this case more than a single layout<br>is ideal. (The logic Fractal and three lines of five K-line, were very<br>similar, but uses more time to further reduce the possibility of wrongful<br>convictions because of disorderly market fluctuations may cause the turning<br>point leading to the illusion, and the daily trading process time Game two<br>dimensions and space everywhere)</p>
<p>Finally, it should say is, one thing should be noted that, due to four hours<br>is still regarded as a level graphics short-term graphics, so even in the days<br>of the transaction follow-up, four hours moving average level also displaced<br>many times, so this short-term trading ideas for draining the requirements are<br>relatively high, especially in the market choppy (general in the event of a<br>price band early start), the investors must spend more time to stare disk in<br>real time and adjust the trading scheme, or is likely to lead to missed<br>opportunities for admission to happen.</p>
