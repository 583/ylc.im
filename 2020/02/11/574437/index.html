        <p>halved currency, a concept noun recent rise, BTC, BCH, BSV, ETC is hot “money<br>in half.” It should be noted that the currency is not halved things a newborn.</p>
<p>For a certain understanding of the encryption currency friend, “halving the<br>money” is very easy to understand, is that the currency has halved mining<br>incentive mechanism design, They can be called halved currency.</p>
<p>further explanation, we must first understand what is mining reward half. Here<br>to Bitcoin for example, we know the total circulation of Bitcoins is 21<br>million, and so many Bitcoin is not issued all at once, but little by little<br>produce mining until all 21 million bitcoins being dug. Nakamoto Bitcoin<br>mining in the design, on the one hand to mobilize the enthusiasm of the early<br>miners, on the other hand to make Bitcoin become increasingly valuable<br>(currency price higher and higher), based on the principle of supply and<br>demand relationship between the design market every four years the mining<br>reward halving the rules. Bitcoin born in just the first four years, miners<br>dug after the success blocks available 50-bit coin reward; after the first<br>halved in 2012, successfully dug block reward, becomes 25; 2016 after the 2nd<br>half, reward becomes 12.5 Bitcoin. 2020 is the third year of halving Bitcoin,<br>after the May (estimated time) in half this year, mining reward will become<br>6.25.</p>
<p>in the past 11 years, half due to a bit after each increment on the market<br>reduction credits bit credits become more scarce, thus boosting its prices. In<br>the past two encryption money market bull market, it has tied up with the<br>association halved Bitcoin. So after halving the price rise caused by<br>currency, also known as “halving the market.”</p>
<p>May 2020 (estimated), the third time in half a year mining reward Bitcoin,<br>people’s expectations that this will bring new Bitcoin round of the bull<br>market. Because it is directly related to the miners, investors and other<br>participants in pocket money, as much attention.</p>
<p>Further, after the birth of numerous credits bit encryption imitate it<br>currency, credits and bifurcated by a bit from the bifurcated credits, many of<br>them also used “halved” design, but not necessarily four years halved once,<br>not necessarily reduce by half the reward (such as ETC rate cut this year only<br>20%).</p>
<p>By 2020, many encryption currency Bitcoin follow, have chosen to be halved<br>this year, removing the currently most influential Bitcoin, concern high BCH,<br>BSV, eTC and other currencies, as well as dozens of smaller coins have chosen<br>to be halved by 2020. Therefore, in 2020, also known as the halving.</p>
<p>It is expected that this year is likely to usher in a new wave of the bull<br>market, current market conditions also support this expectation. But this is<br>not absolute, because the encryption in the currency market after ten years of<br>development, become more complex, more and more factors that affect the value<br>of the currency, how much influence halve the effect of actually left, is not<br>known.</p>
